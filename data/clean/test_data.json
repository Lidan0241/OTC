        "content":"Watch CBS News\nByStefan Becket,Graham Kates\nMay 14, 2024 \/ 12:09 PM EDT\/ CBS News\nA New York court on Tuesday rejected former President Donald Trump's bid to lift the gag order limiting what he can say about those involved in his ongoing criminal trial, saying the order does not violate Trump's First Amendment rights.\nJustice Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump's trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records,issued the original orderin March, barring Trump from discussing likely witnesses, jurors, attorneys and court staff involved in the case. Merchan laterexpandedit to apply to his daughter.\nTrump was not prevented from criticizing Merchan or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nIn afive-page rulingon Tuesday, the appellate division, first department of the New York Supreme Court, found that Merchan \"properly determined that [Trump's] public statements posed a significant threat to the integrity of the testimony of witnesses and potential witnesses in this case.\"\n\"We find that Justice Merchan properly weighed petitioner's First Amendment Rights against the court's historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, and the right of persons related or tangentially related to the criminal proceedings from being free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm,\" the ruling said.\nMerchan hasheld Trump in contempt of courtfor violating the order 10 times. Last week, he warned Trump that he could be sent to jail for future violations.\nThe latest violation concerned comments Trump made about the political make-up of the jury. In a written order on May 6, Merchan said Trump's comments \"not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.\"\nTrump's attorney Todd Blancheasked Merchanto modify the gag order in court last week to allow Trump to \"respond publicly to what happened in court the last day and a half,\" referring to testimony by Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who received $130,000 in 2016 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\nMerchan rejected Blanche's request, saying the order is in place \"because of the nature of the attacks, the vitriol\" from Trump.\n\"Your client's track record speaks for itself,\" Merchan said.\nStefan Becket is managing editor, digital politics, for CBSNews.com.

The United Nationsestimatesthat at least 1.7 million people \u2014 more than half of Gaza's population \u2014 have been displaced from their homes since the war started.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant since Oct. 7 that the only way to respond to Hamas' slaughter of some 1,200 people is to destroy the group, and he's vowed to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, the last Gazan city so far spared an all-out assault.\nIsrael says there are four Hamas battalions still there, but there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians who sought refuge in the southern city over seven months of war, and the U.S. and other Israeli allies have warned against a full-scale ground invasion.\nMuch of the rest of Gaza has already been left in ruins by Israel's overwhelming firepower \u2014 much of it supplied by the U.S., and withmuch more said to be on the waysoon.\nFor the Palestinian people, it's already been a crisis on a scale far greater than the violence and displacement of 76 years ago, and with the prospect of a Rafah incursion looming, thousands havefled in fear for their lives all over again.\nOn Tuesday, Israelis marked their Independence Day. Normally a time of celebration, this year's commemorations were largely somber, as Israelis continue to call on their leaders to reach a deal to free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be alive and held by Hamas or other groups in Gaza.\nCBS News' Tucker Reals contributed to this report.\nImtiaz Tyab is a CBS News correspondent based in London.\nFirst published on May 15, 2024 \/ 9:48 AM EDT\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "title":"\"Oatzempic\" craze: Should you try the oat drink for weight loss? Experts weigh in.",
        "content":"Watch CBS News\nBySara Moniuszko\nEdited ByPaula Cohen\nApril 4, 2024 \/ 4:15 PM EDT\/ CBS News\nAnother weight loss trend is making its roundson social media\u2014 this time in the form of a drink called \"oatzempic.\" The name combines a reference to oats, one of the drink's ingredients, with a play onOzempic, the diabetes drug that's becomepopular for weight loss\u2014 even though there's no prescription medication involved.\nSome TikTok users claim the drink \u2014 made with oats, water and lime juice \u2014 can help someone lose up to 40 pounds in as little as 2 months. Experts, however, say to be wary of any trend that promises to purge pounds fast.\nLisa Valente, a registered dietitian and nutrition editor atHealthline, calls the trend \"clever marketing for something that has no merit behind it.\"\n\"Blended oat drinks are not the same as prescription drugs. It also seems like a dangerous trend that promotes disordered eating and isn't nutritionally sound or based in science,\" she told CBS News.\nMaggie Evans, a registered dietitian and care specialist with virtual cardiometabolic care platform9amHealth, calls the trend an \"extreme measure.\"\n\"As we've seen before, whether it'sMaster Cleanse, water fasts or other extreme diets, these (trends) may result in short-term weight loss results, but aren't the healthiest or most sustainable way to achieve that weight loss,\" she says.\nTikTok has not blocked the term and hashtag (a step it appears to have taken for some other body image-relatedtrends like \"legging legs\"), but when you search for \"oatzempic\" on the app, a banner appears saying \"you are more than your weight,\" with links to resources.\n\"Fast weight loss can be possible when you restrict calories significantly, and this drink is quite low in calories, so if you are using it as a meal replacement, it may lead to fast weight loss,\" Valente explains. \"However, I wouldn't recommend it because it is not a safe way to lose weight.\"\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people who take the approach ofgradual, steady weight lossare more likely to keep the weight off than people who lose weight quickly.\n\"If a person stops the oatzempic diet, they're likely to regain the weight they lost and may end up in a yo-yo dieting cycle,\" says Dr. Avantika Waring, an endocrinologist and chief medical officer of 9amHealth. \"We know that medically, losing and regaining weight repeatedly can actually make sustaining a healthy weight harder.\"\nWaring says rapid weight loss can also result in:\n\"Underfueling the body can also lead to constipation, dehydration, dizziness and menstrual irregularities,\" she says.\nYes, oats are a heart-healthy whole grain that can be part of a balanced diet, experts say, and theirhigh fiber contentcan also help us feel satisfied and fuller longer. But they're no \"magic solution\" for weight loss.\n\"We don't have any data to suggest it is effective for weight loss, and it's likely that having a blended oat drink for breakfast would be as healthy as eating a bowl of oatmeal without added sugars or topped with just fresh fruit \u2014 which might also taste better!\" Waring says.\nPlus, experts note the oatzempic drink is missing key nutrients like protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.\n\"There are other safer, healthier ways to lose weight that involve making small changes to your diet and don't remove entire foods or food groups,\" Valente says.\nIn general, false or misleading information can be rampant on social media. Experts say they've seen increased misinformation regarding weight loss in the past year, specifically related to the interest in drugs like Ozempic.\n\"Everything from'nature's Ozempic' \u2014 aka berberine, an ineffective and potentially dangerous supplement \u2014 to overblown, fear-inducing side effects like 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt,'\" Dr. James Wantuck, co-founder and chief medical officer of PlushCare,previously told CBS News.\nNutrition is also a nuanced topic, Valente adds, making it difficult to explain in a short, 10-second clip online.\n\"If you have questions about what you eat, I always recommend speaking with a health care professional rather than consulting social media,\" she says.\nSara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

        "content":"Watch CBS News\nByKate Gibson\nEdited ByAlain Sherter\nUpdated on:  May 17, 2024 \/ 10:32 PM EDT\/ CBS News\nMercedes-Benz employees at two of the German automaker's facilities in Alabama have voted against joining the United Auto Workers, dealing a blow to the labor group's effort to make deeper inroads in Southern states.\nMercedes Workers voted 2,045 to 2,642, or 56% to 44%, against joining the UAW, the National Labor Relations Board said Friday. For the union to prevail, it needed to get 50% plus one of valid votes cast.\n\"This is obviously not the result we wanted,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a news conference after the results were tallied. \"With weak labor laws in place, enforcement can be a struggle, and sometimes these companies can turn things around.\"\n\"This is a setback, this is the same playbook they always follow \u2014 it's ugly, it's brutal and it's wrong,\" Fain added of UAW claims that Mercedes had threatened and even fired workers to snuff out support for the union.\nMercedes reiterated prior denials that it had fired workers because of their organizing activities.\n\"Our goal throughout this process was to ensure every eligible team member had the opportunity to participate in a fair election,\" the automaker said in a statement. \"We thank all team members who asked questions, engaged in discussions, and ultimately, made their voices heard on this important issue.\"\nThe election for production and maintenance workers at the Mercedes plants near Tuscaloosa comes less than 30 days after Volkswagen workers in in Chattanooga, Tennessee, votedto join the UAW.\nDavid Johnston, 26, an employee at the Mercedes battery plant in Woodstock, had expected the UAW to prevail in its first election at the plant. \"I'm really optimistic and expect numbers similar to Volkswagen,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday, a day ahead of the count. \"We've had the same old tactics from Mercedes for years now, and most of us are ready for some stability and better work-life balance.\"\nThe UAW has vowed to commit$40 millionthrough 2026 to widen its reach to additional auto and electric vehicle workers, including in Southern states, where BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia and Nissan also have operations.\nThe UAW has been on a roll sincewinning major concessionslast fall from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-owner Stellantis, where workers gained 33% pay hikes in contracts that will expire in 2028.\nTop-scale production workers at GM, who now earn about $36 an hour, will make nearly $43 an hour by the end of their contract, plus annual profit-sharing checks.\n\"That's what finally got people talking about a union. In the South it's hush-hush, but after the Big Three win everyone would talk,\" said Johnston, a father of two who makes $26.50 an hour.\nThe union also recently reached an agreement with truck and bus manufacturer Daimler Truck, averting apotential strike by more than 7,000 workersin North Carolina. Daimler is a spinoff from what is now Mercedes.\n\"We're a luxury brand, and I'm missing the first year of my daughter growing up,\" said Johnston, who is switching to a new job at the Mercedes assembly plant in Vance, a move he said would mark his seventh schedule change since he started with the company in August of 2022. One role involved working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, he added.\nMercedes has waged a concerted effort to dissuade workers from unionizing, according to workers in Alabama and labor experts. The company also announced that it would eliminate a two-tier pay system that resulted in more recent hires being paid substantially less.\nIn contrast to Volkswagen, where the UAW narrowly lost two previous votes and faced less vehement opposition to its workforce's union drive, \"Mercedes is red-hot opposed,\" said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noting that Mercedes hired a consulting firm and coordinated with local political leaders to fight the UAW.\nMercedes is accused of disciplining workers for discussing a union, firing union supporters and forcing employees to attend meetings while making \"statements suggesting that union activity is futile,\" according to the NLRB. The agency is investigating six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW against the company since March.\nMercedes denies interfering with the union campaign or retaliating against employees.\nMercedes' management has gotten backing from Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who on Monday said she had signed legislation that revokes tax incentives for corporations that voluntarily recognize labor unions.\n\"Alabama is not Michigan,\" the Republicantolda Chamber of Commerce function in Huntsville. \"We want to ensure that Alabama values, not Detroit values, continue to define the future of this great state.\"\nKay was among six Southern governors who signed a lettercondemning efforts by the UAWto organize car factories in their states, saying it threatened jobs and values.\n\u2014The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nKate Gibson is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch in New York.\nFirst published on May 17, 2024 \/ 11:30 AM EDT\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "title":"Nearly 80 officials overseeing elections in 7 swing states doubt 2020 results",
        "content":"Watch CBS News\nByMadeleine May,Caitlin Huey-Burns\nUpdated on:  May 14, 2024 \/ 8:05 PM EDT\/ CBS News\nReno\u2014 Washoe County, Nevada, is a battleground county in a critical battleground state and may hold the keys to congressional contests, and potentially the presidency. But in this cycle, one of the most consequential races in the state is that of county commissioner.\nThat commissioner would wield the swing vote on a panel that \u2014 among other responsibilities \u2014 oversees elections in Washoe. Members appoint the county's top election official, set the budget for elections and ultimately certify statewide election results.\n\"It's important to realize that we are in a national election, that national election is being run at the local level,\" said Democratic Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar in an interview. \"And at that local level, they can completely shut down the election at the state, for the state and for the nation.\"\nAt a time when the electoral process has come under withering attack by former President Donald Trump and his boisterous MAGA following, control of the elections has emerged as a target of his allies in places like Washoe County, despite a persistent lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud in Washoe, or any other county in the U.S.\nA new CBS News investigation found there are nearly 80 officials working in election oversight positions across seven battleground states, including Nevada, who don't believe the 2020 election results, refused to certify the election, publicly supported the actions taken onJan. 6, 2021 in the U.S. Capitol riotsor have pushed election conspiracies.\nIn Washoe, the power of the commission has attracted the attention of a powerful and wealthy right-wing activist named Robert Beadles, who has falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged. Since 2022, he has been lobbying in support of controversial voting changes introduced by other Commissioners, which include eliminating voting machines in favor of hand-counting paper ballots and having the National Guard at polling places \u2014 steps the ACLU has called \"categorically illegal.\"\nBeadles, who says he made his fortune in real estate and cryptocurrency, has spent significantly in local elections for school board, city council and the state legislature. He has also spent over $100,000 on commission races, particularly in support of two of the five current commissioners, Jeannie Herman and Michael Clark,both of whomhave pushed election conspiracies or denied that Joe Biden won the election. This cycle, he aims to build a majority on the commission to promote his agenda.\n\"We have our two superheros on the county commission. We have Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman.\" Beadles said in a video posted to his Facebook. \"However, those two votes are not enough. We need three.\"\n\"If you want to save a county, you save the county commission, because they're the ones with one vote that can fix or destroy the county,\" Beadles told CBS News at a local Republican event he was moderating. \"People are looking at the president and Senate and all those types and that's great, but that one person can't necessarily make a difference. As much as one person in the county commission or city council can, they could sway the entire board.\"\nIn his pursuit of one more vote on the county commission, Beadles has targeted fellow Republican and a current commissioner, Clara Andriola, for defeat in the upcoming June primary. Andriola has held the line against the voting changes Beadles has proposed \u2014 which contributed to her censure by the Washoe County GOP \u2014 where Beadles serves on the executive committee. That committee alsopassed a resolutionin 2022 claiming that President Biden was not legitimately elected.\n\"It was disappointing. It was hurtful \u2026 but I am a Republican, I still am a Republican and I will vote as a Republican,\" Andriola said of the censure. When asked how she thinks elections are run in Washoe, Andriola told CBS News. \"I think elections have been run as best as we can.\"\nBut for Beadles, Andriola is not Republican enough. Instead, he is backing several other Republican candidates, including Andriola's primary opponent, Republican Tracey Hilton-Thomas. In an interview with CBS, during a campaign stop, Hilton-Thomas says she works closely with Beadles and current Republican Commissioner to draft new election resolutions.\n\"I do believe that there is interference in our elections,\" said Hilton-Thomas. When asked whether she believed the results of the 2020 election, she said: \"I would have to say at this time, no, I do not believe the results \u2026 they won't show us, they won't show us the proof, we have to just trust their word. And I'm not a person that trusts people's word.\"\nBeadles has continued to peddle false claims about election fraud. In 2022, hetoldthe Washoe County Commission that \"the elections are rigged \u2026 it's treason, you all are committing treason.\" He directed much of his ire about the election at County Registrar Deanna Spikula, who laterresignedher position after facing an onslaught of harassment. Beadles has denied any responsibility for the harassment of Spikula or other officials.\nBeadles filed a lawsuit to try and block the The Election Worker Protection Act, which makes it a felony to harass, threaten or intimidate election workers. The suit has twice been rejected in federal court, but Beadlesfiledanother appeal earlier this month.\u00a0 A public affairs officer with Washoe County Commissions said there has been a 100% turnover of election officials in that office since 2020.\nThe Reno activist has been promoted bySteve Bannon, a former top adviser to Donald Trump.\n\"They're really scared of Trump, but what they should be scared of is like 25 (million) to 100 million little Trump 2.0s running around the country,\" Beadles said on Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast.\nIn the June 11 primary, Washoe County voters will decide whether or not to vote out Andriola. And if Beadles is successful in getting one more vote on the commission, his allies will be in charge of certifying elections in the future.\nAguilar, the Nevada secretary of state, says election deniers \"understand the power of a county at the national level \u2026 Nevada is a battleground state, we are going to be part of a small group of states who determines the next president of the United States. And when you start to break down the data in the information county by county, you start to recognize the power of Washoe.\"\nFirst published on May 14, 2024 \/ 6:53 PM EDT\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

In 2023, orders for tests were accepted through the end of May.\nSlowing case rates drove the decision to pause orders for the sixth round of test shipments, the spokesperson said. Tests could still be distributed again by ASPR in the future.\nThe CDCsaidon March 1 that some COVID-19 trends remain elevated nationwide but have been decreasing in recent weeks from last winter's peak.\nIt comes days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged innew guidancethat rapid \"antigen\" tests \u2013 like the kind in the USPS program \u2013 had \"relatively low\" sensitivity, with \"significant numbers of false negative\" results early during an infection.\n\"If it's positive, we see very few false positives, we know that you have COVID. But it is still possible to have a false negative. So it can be reassuring, but it is not a guarantee that you don't have COVID if you see a negative,\" CDC Director Dr. Mandy CohentoldCBS News.\nAll pandemic-era supplies of Paxlovid are also scheduled to stop being dispensed by pharmacies Friday, following adecisionearlier this year by the Food and Drug Administration to wrap up the transition of Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment into the private market.\nFDA documents show Pfizer had asked to end emergency use authorization as early as January for distribution of the government-bought pills, which have been free to all Americans. Citing concerns that this cutoff could result in an \"acute lack of availability,\" the FDA said it would delay it until March.\nAprogramrun by the National Institutes of Health and ASPR called Home Test to Treat still offers free at-home tests to uninsured or underinsured adults, as well as those on Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Affairs system or Indian Health Services.\nThe homemoleculartests delivered by that program \u2013 Pfizer's Lucira test for COVID-19 and flu \u2013 are more sensitive than other kinds of at-home rapid antigen tests that had been shipped from the USPS orders.\nThat program is set to wind down in mid-April, a spokesperson for the NIH's National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering told CBS News.\nThe CDC's Increasing Community Access to Testing program, which subsidizes free testing for uninsured Americans, is also still running at thousands of pharmacies. Funding for that program has been set aside until May 2025, officials have said.\n\"We have testing sites in all 50 states, including D.C. and Puerto Rico. We have about 10,000 active testing sites and any given week, about 2,000 to 2,500 sites are testing,\" the CDC's Joseph Miller said at a Januarymeetingof the agency's advisers.\nFederal officials have stressed for months that Americans will still have ways to get free or reduced-price Paxlovid under theirdeal struck with Pfizer, even after supplies of the COVID-19 treatment finish switching over to the private market versions this month.\nAll adults insured by Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Affairs Community Care Network are eligible to get free Paxlovid through the end of 2024 from Pfizer through a government-backedpatient assistance program. Uninsured Americans are also eligible.\nOthers with private insurance are still able to request free or reduced price Paxlovid or rebates through Pfizer's PAXCESS program, if their insurance does not cover the cost of their pills.\n\"Bottom line is no one should be paying full price for Paxlovid,\" ASPR's Meghan Pennini told a National Press Foundationeventin January.\nAlexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

Doctors for years have known the benefits of spending time outdoors.\nClinical psychologist Dr. Sarah Paper previouslyexplainedthat sunlight is part of what makes time outside so uplifting.\n\"The sun seems to increase our serotonin, which makes us happier and we can feel more connected, not just to the people around us who are also outside, that's a big part, but also connected to the bigger universe,\" she said, adding that she recommends spending at least two hours a week in nature.\nTo optimize nature's calming effect, Slot suggests breathing in fresh air and focusing on the sights and sounds around you.\nYou don't need to live near a magnificent mountainside or other spectacular landscape to feel the effects, either.\n\"Even a pretty dandelion,\" Paper says. \"If you can take in the beauty there, and not just see it as a weed, that helps us and it trains our brain not to look for the negative or upsetting things but rather look for the beauty in the world around us. And that give us hope, too.\"\nNeuropsychologist Dr. Rita Eichensteintold CBS Los Angelesin 2021 that even a few minutes outside can reduce stress levels quickly, especially when paired with exercise.\n\"Research has shown that being in nature is calming,\" she said. \"If you have 20 minutes ... take it and move your body.

        "title":"Four takeaways from our investigation into police agencies selling their guns",
        "content":"Watch CBS News\nByJohn Kelly,Chris Hacker\nUpdated on:  May 16, 2024 \/ 11:12 AM EDT\/ CBS News\nAbout nine times a day over two decades, a gun used in a crime has been traced back to its original owner: a law enforcement agency.\nAjoint investigation by CBS News, The Trace, and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting has found at least 52,000 such incidents and identified more than 140 police agencies that sell or trade in their guns, allowing dealers to then resell them.\nHere's a look at the key findings of the investigation.You can read and watch the complete investigation here.\nLaw enforcement agencies are sellingand trading their old duty weapons \u2014 often to cut costs when upgrading. A side effect: tens of thousands of those guns have wound up in the hands of criminals.\nThey've been used in shootings, domestic violence incidents, and other violent crimes, according to records obtained from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and hundreds of U.S. police agencies.\nInternal ATF records show at least 52,529 police guns turned up at crime scenes since 2006, the earliest year data is available from the government.\nCBS News journalists surveyed state and local law enforcement agencies coast to coast and found at least 145 agencies resold their guns between 2006 and 2022. That's about 90% of the agencies that responded.\nMany of the police agencies that resold or traded in their weapons were the same ones who routinely hold gun buyback events they say are aimed at reducing the number of guns on the street.\nThe Philadelphia Police Department boasts on its website of having collected 825 guns in buybacks since 2021.\nBut records obtained in the CBS News investigation show the agency resold at least 886 of its officers' former duty guns over the past two decades.\nThe Newark Police Department staged a buyback in 2021, offering $250 for each firearm. People turned in 146 guns.\n\"Without question, 146 fewer firearms on our streets means less gun violence, fewer gun violence victims, and less risk of suicide or death,\" public safety director Brian O'Hara said in a YouTube post.\nFive years earlier, the Newark agency resold more than five times that number of guns \u2014 nearly 1,000. One ended up in Pittsburgh, where police seized it from a convicted felon in 2019 after he allegedly fired more than a dozen shots in a neighborhood and then led officers on a foot chase.\nA Newark Police spokesperson said the guns had been traded in as a cost-saving measure under a previous administration.\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Tiahrt Amendment. Named after the lawmaker who introduced it, Tiahrt bars the ATF from letting the public see most trace information about guns used in crimes.\nATF cited the Tiahrt amendment in rejecting a public records request filed in 2017 by our reporting partners on this project, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting.\nReveal sued. In 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled ATF had to release some of the summary statistical information.\nThe limited records released during that litigation showed more than 52,000 guns used in crimes had been traced back to law enforcement agencies. A small sample of the underlying data showed at least 800 different agencies' old firearms ended up at crime scenes.\nFederal law enforcement agencies are legally required to destroy their used guns. State and local agencies make their own decisions.\nMost sell or trade them in \u2014 but not all.\nIn Seattle, police stopped trading in handguns around 2016.\n\"If we're selling them out, we just don't know where those guns could end up,\" Police Chief Adrian Diaz said. \"We don't want to contribute to the problem.\"\nIndianapolis Police Chief Christopher Bailey told CBS News that his agency has historically traded in its weapons, but he would consider changing that policy after a recent shooting death involving a former police duty gun sold by a sheriff's office in California.\n\"I don't want any weapon that we owned to end up being used violently against another person,\" Bailey said.\nAfter CBS News Minnesota showed Minneapolis police officials our findings, Police Chief Brian O'Hara said his department would change its policy.\n\"I don't want us to be in a position where a weapon that was once in service for the police department here is then winding up used in a crime, or in an act of violence against a person, or even to shoot a police officer,\" O'Hara said. \"So going forward, we're not going to be selling any weapons at all.\"\nYou can read and watch the complete investigation here.\nJohn Kelly is an investigative journalist and the Vice President of Data Journalism for CBS News and Stations.\nFirst published on May 16, 2024 \/ 6:00 AM EDT\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Riley Financial. \"It's like getting a gold star in school \u2014 guess what, things are OK.\"\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that stocks have continued climbing as the U.S. seems headed for a so-calledsoft landingin which inflation recedes to more normal levels and economic growth remains healthy. Consumer spending and job gains, while slowing, also remain robust enough to stave off a prolonged slump even as the Federal Reserve pushes back its timeline for cutting its benchmark interest rate.\n\"Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all last year \u2014 now we are once again back to new highs,\" he said. \"Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history.\"\nThe Dow hit the historic mark as Walmart jumped 7% after delivering robust first-quarter results. After hitting a high of 40,051, the index turned lower to close at 39,869, down 38.6 points, or 0.1%, on the day. The big-box retailer reported a large jump in e-commerce sales, as well as making inroads with high-income shoppers.\n\"These are not inflation-driven results,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts on an earnings call.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose to record heights before paring their gains, ending 0.2% and 0.3% lower.\nA slowly cooling, but still resilient, economy has supported corporate earnings even as expectations of five or six interest rate cuts by the Fed this year have ebbed. Odds of a rate cut in September increased some after data released on Wednesday showeda slight moderation in consumer prices in April.\n\"The reestablishment of a disinflation trend in the coming months should allow the Fed to start easing policy in September,\" according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, who still expects Fed cuts of 50 basis points in total this year.\nLower rates are likely ahead as inflation \"drastically\" improves in the second half of 2024, according to Detrick at the Carson Group. \"It is an election year, so expect some bumps, but overall the bull market that stared in October 2022 is alive and well.\"\nFrom Hogan's perch, investors are just fine foregoing multiple rates cuts as long as the economy continues to perform and drive corporate earnings.

        "title":"OpenAI says Sam Altman to return as CEO just days after the board sacked him and he said he'd join Microsoft",
        "content":"Watch CBS News\nUpdated on:  November 22, 2023 \/ 2:38 PM EST\/ CBS\/AP\nSan Francisco\u2014 OpenAI said Tuesday that its co-founder Sam Altman would return to the tech company as CEO, just days afterhe was firedby its board of directors and then quicklyannounced that he was joining Microsoft.\n\"We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo,\" OpenAI said in a post on the social media platform X.\nIn his own statement on the platform, Altman said he loved OpenAI and that everything he'd done \"over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.\"\nOpenAI also said it is forming a new board that will include former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who will serve as chair; economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and existing director Adam D'Angelo, CEO of Quora. Three directors involved in the decision to oust Altman \u2014 \u00a0Ilya Sutskever, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley \u2014 are leaving the board.\nOpenAI's previous board, which included D'Angelo, had refused to give specific reasons for firing Altman, leading to a weekend of internal conflict at the company and growing outside pressure from the startup's investors.\nFormer OpenAI president Greg Brockman, who left Friday along with Altman, is also returning to the company, although neither he nor Altman will serve on the new board,accordingto The Information.\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said he expects the overhaul to OpenAI's board to strengthen its governance. \"The former, now infamous, board members are finally gone after the failed coup, and now in essence OpenAI will be virtually the same than before this soap opera began,\" he said in report.\nHelping to drive Altman's return and the installation of a new board was Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology. After Altman's dismissal, the software giant quickly moved to hire him and Brockman. That emboldened a threat to resign by hundreds of OpenAI employees, who signed a letter calling for the board's resignation and Altman's return.\nAltman said that when he decided on Sunday evening to join Microsoft, \"it was clear that was the best path for me and the team,\" but he said the new board announced by OpenAI \u2014 and the support of Microsoft's chairman and CEO Satya Nadella \u2014 he was looking forward to returning to the company he helped establish and \"to building on our strong partnership with\" the software giant.\nNadella said Microsoft's leadership had been \"encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board\" and that the company believed they were \"a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\"\nOpenAI, which makes the popular artificial intelligence powered chatbot ChatGPT, said Friday that Altman was pushed out after a review found he was \"not consistently candid in his communications\" with the board of directors, which had lost confidence in his ability to lead OpenAI.\nOne Wall Street research firm said, however, that it believed tensions had arisen over Altman's push to develop more advanced products.\n\"These tensions likely resulted in frustrating communications and Sam making some operational decisions without keeping the board fully aware,\" said New Street Research in a research note. \"The coup, and the sibylline associated blog post, about Sam not being 'consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities' resulted from this situation.\"\nOne board member tweeted that they regretted their participation in the decision to oust Altman.\n\"I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company,\" wrote board member Ilya Sutskever in a Monday morning social media post.\nAltman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame while serving as company CEO and in the past year has become Silicon Valley's sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\nFirst published on November 22, 2023 \/ 2:04 AM EST\n\u00a9 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "content":"Watch CBS News\nByHaley Ott\nUpdated on:  May 16, 2024 \/ 5:11 PM EDT\/ CBS News\nThe Israel Defense Forces said five of its soldiers, all between 20 and 22 years old, were killed byIsraeli tank firein northern Gaza on Wednesday evening. An initial internal investigation found that two tanks fired at a building in the Jabalia refugee camp where the soldiers had gathered. The building was being used by the deputy commander of the battalion, according to an IDF statement.\n\"It appears that the tank fighters, from the ultra-Orthodox paratrooper company 'Hatz,' identified a barrel of a weapon coming out of one of the windows in the building, and directed each other to shoot at the building,\" the IDF statement said.\n\"This is a very difficult incident, the work environment is under very complex operational stress and in a very crowded area,\" IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Thursday. \"We are in the middle of the investigation, we will learn the lessons. Maintaining the security of our forces is a central task.\"\nThe incident came as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after a situational assessment at the Gaza border in Rafah, said more Israeli troops would be entering Gaza.\n\"Several tunnels in the area have been destroyed by our troops and additional tunnels will be destroyed soon,\" Gallant said Wednesday. \"This activity will intensify \u2013 Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize, it does not have reserve troops, it has no supply stocks and no ability to treat the terrorists that we target. The result is that we are wearing Hamas down.\"\nAs IDF operations continued, Gallant publicly challenged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week about his post-war plans for the Gaza Strip.\nIn addition to military action, Gallant said in a televised statement that \"the establishment of a governing alternative in Gaza\" in the wake of almost 20 years of Hamas rule was also crucial to Israel's stated objective of dismantling the group. \"In the absence of such an alternative, only two negative options remain: Hamas' rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza.\"\nGallant said he would oppose the latter scenario and urged Netanyahu to formally rule it out.\nHe said he had been trying to promote a plan to create a \"non-hostile Palestinian governing alternative\" to Hamas since October, but that he'd received no response from the Israeli cabinet.\nGallant has previously suggested the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, could have a role in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has dismissed that suggestion, also floated by the United States, as have various members of the PA.\nOn Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari was asked if the lack of a post-war strategy for Gaza was hindering military operations there.\n\"There is no doubt that an alternative to Hamas would generate pressure on Hamas, but that's a question for the government echelon,\" he said.\nHaley Ott is the CBS News Digital international reporter, based in the CBS News London bureau.\nFirst published on May 16, 2024 \/ 3:06 PM EDT\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

And that would be an indication that your heart is getting healthier,\" he says.\n\"Certain devices can also provide insight into potential key health indicators - such as your respiratory rates, activity level and more,\" Nunez says. \"For some users, the data can also indicate how your body is responding to stress.\"\nRespiratory rate is a metric that may alert someone to other health issues, too. That's something Michael Snyder, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who has studied smartwatches, experienced firsthand after coming down withCOVID-19. Though he took a COVID test that came back negative, his own research app alerted him to sudden changes in his breathing and heart rates.\n\"I listened to my COVID test, and I should have listened my smartwatch,\" hetold CBS Newsin a 2022 interview.\nTracking metrics likecardiac rhythmmay help alert patients to a bigger problems.\n\"I had a patient whose Apple Watch told them that they had a run of atrial fibrillation,\" Lundquist said. \"We got this person into a cardiologist \u2014 sure enough, it was confirmed and the patient was adequately treated.\"\n\"Afib (atrial fibrillation) is a big deal,\" cardiologist Dr. Tara Narulatold \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018as Apple rolled out electrocardiogram technology in its smartwatches to help detect the heart issue. \"It affects millions of Americans, increases hospitalization rates (and) increases death and heart failure.\"\nIt also increases risk for potentially debilitating strokes by five times, she added.\n\"The problem with afib is that it can be asymptomatic, so you can be walking around and not know you have it while you're at increased risk of stroke,\" she explained, noting that a tracking device could help empower patients, but could also lead to false alarm: \"Anxiety, false positives, flooding doctors' offices with calls. There are definitely downsides, but I think this has the potential to really be very helpful down the road,\"\nHealth trackers have come a long way, doctors says, but you shouldn't rely on these devices for 100% accuracy or diagnosis. The FDA has specificallywarned against any device that claimsto measure blood sugar without needles, since inaccuracies could lead to serious health consequences.\nFor other types of tracking, \"The accuracy of some of the smartwatches is still a little bit in question, although with each generation they're getting better. So I think overall, physicians are getting more confident in trusting these devices,\" Lundquist says. Plus, as he points out, users also have to take off the device to charge, meaning data won't be recorded 24\/7.\nWhile trackers can be a \"valuable tool for many,\" Nunez says the data shouldn't be used to diagnose serious sleep or health issues.\n\"Ultimately, sleep tracking devices can help to empower users to set and achieve health goals but are not a substitute for formal diagnosis or professional medical care,\" he says.\nThey can also help physicians partner with their patients, Lundquist says.\n\"As these applications become more mainstream, the ability to show up in your with your doctor's appointment, pull up your phone and show them your metrics would be a great way for us to partner with our patients and help them see where there's potential opportunities or problems,\" he says.\nSara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.
