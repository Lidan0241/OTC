Ramallah, West Bank— For Palestinians, Wednesday marks the ""Nakba."" The word means catastrophe, and the date marks the mass displacement in 1948 of more than 700,000 Palestinians upon the formation of the modern state of Israel.
It has been 76 years since that happened, but this year, Palestinians are also commemorating what some are calling a second Nakba — the currentwar in the Gaza Strip, which has been perhaps the most horrific and the bloodiest chapter in the history of the Palestinian people.
Since Gaza's Hamas rulers sparked the war with their Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, more than 35,000Palestinians have been killedby Israel's retaliatory offensive in the territory, according to its health ministry. The United Nationsestimatesthat at least 1.7 million people — more than half of Gaza's population — have been displaced from their homes since the war started.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant since Oct. 7 that the only way to respond to Hamas' slaughter of some 1,200 people is to destroy the group, and he's vowed to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, the last Gazan city so far spared an all-out assault.
Israel says there are four Hamas battalions still there, but there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians who sought refuge in the southern city over seven months of war, and the U.S. and other Israeli allies have warned against a full-scale ground invasion.
Much of the rest of Gaza has already been left in ruins by Israel's overwhelming firepower — much of it supplied by the U.S., and withmuch more said to be on the waysoon.
For the Palestinian people, it's already been a crisis on a scale far greater than the violence and displacement of 76 years ago, and with the prospect of a Rafah incursion looming, thousands havefled in fear for their lives all over again.
On Tuesday, Israelis marked their Independence Day. Normally a time of celebration, this year's commemorations were largely somber, as Israelis continue to call on their leaders to reach a deal to free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be alive and held by Hamas or other groups in Gaza.

Ventura, Calif.— A judge decided Wednesday that a Southern California college professor will stand trial for involuntary manslaughter and battery in the death of a Jewish counter-protester during demonstrations overthe Israel-Hamas warlast year.
Superior Court Judge Ryan Wright judge declared after a two-day preliminary hearing that there's enough evidence to try Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji,according to the Ventura County District Attorney's Office.
Alnaji, 51, is accused of striking Paul Kessler with a megaphone in November during a confrontation at an event that started as a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Thousand Oaks, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles.
Kessler, 69, fell backward and struck his head on the pavement. He died the next day at a hospital.
Alnaji was charged with two felonies: involuntary manslaughter and battery causing serious bodily injury, with special allegations of personally inflicting great bodily harm injury on each count, the DA's office said. If found guilty of all charges, he could be sentenced to more than four years in prison.
Alnaji posted $50,000 bail. An Associated Press email and phone message for Alnaji's lawyer, Ron Bamieh, weren't immediately returned Wednesday.
Alnaji, a professor of computer science at Moorpark College, had espoused pro-Palestinian views on his Facebook page and other social media accounts, many of which were taken down in the days after Kessler's death,according to the Los Angeles Times.
The D.A.'s office says it ""continues to translate and review messages, social media postings, files, and documents belonging to Alnaji. This evaluation is ongoing and comprehensive, but to date it has not revealed evidence to support a hate crime. While antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by Alnaji.""

ByEleanor Watson
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 7:59 PM EDT/ CBS News
The U.S. military on Thursday finished installing the pieces of atemporary pierthat will be used to transport humanitarian aid into Gaza from the Mediterranean Sea, according to the U.S. Central Command.
CENTCOM issued a statement saying its personnel had ""anchored a temporary pier to the beach in Gaza. As part of this effort, no U.S. troops entered Gaza. Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance are expected to begin moving ashore in the coming days. The United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.""
On Wednesday, a defense official told CBS News that, ""Earlier today, components of the temporary pier that make up our Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, along with military vessels involved in its construction, began moving from the Port of Ashdod towards Gaza, where it will be anchored to the beach to assist in the delivery of international humanitarian aid."" The Port of Ashdod in Israel is about 10 miles north of Gaza.
Construction of the two pieces, the floating platform and the causeway, was completed last week, but weather had delayed the final movement.
Gaza's need for more food and supplies has only grown in recent weeks as Israel appears to be ready to launch an offensiveagainst the southern city of Rafah. USAID Response Director Daniel Dieckhaus said that 450,000 Gazans have fled Rafah since May 6.
""Humanitarian actors are facing significant challenges getting aid into Rafah given the closure of critical border crossings as well as accessing warehouses and distributing aid due to the deteriorating situation,"" Dieckhaus told reporters on Wednesday.
The Biden administration has said the corridor will increase the amount of aid getting in, but the pier is not meant to replace the entry points by road, which are far more efficient for bringing aid in quickly.
Initially, the corridor is expected to deliver about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, ramping up to 150 per day once it reaches full capacity, defense officials said in a briefing late last month. The United Nations has said that, to meet the needs of Palestinians trapped in Gaza, about 500 trucks worth of aid per day must enter the territory.
The flow of aid through the corridor is expected to start in Cyprus, where it will be inspected and loaded onto ships to travel about 200 miles to the floating platform in the eastern Mediterranean. Once it arrives, the aid will be transferred by U.S. military vessels to the causeway attached to the coast of Gaza. From there, trucks driven by a third party — not U.S. troops — will take the aid into Gaza.
The Israeli military, accordingto the Pentagon, is providing security on the beachhead, and the U.N. is coordinating the delivery of supplies to people in Gaza.
Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters that hundreds of tons of aid is ready to be delivered once the corridor is up and running, and thousands more tons in the pipeline.
The Pentagon estimates the cost of the corridor to be about $320 million.
President Biden announced the maritime corridor during his State of the Union address in March. After pledging to provide a pier, he said: ""To the leadership of Israel I say this — humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.""
Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will set foot in Gaza. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members devoted to the maritime corridor operation just off the coast.

The Biden administration has informed Congress that it intends to transfer $1 billion in weapons to Israel, two congressional sources confirmed to CBS News Tuesday.
Congress will need to approve the transfer. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news.
The move comes days after the U.S. withheld shipments of certain munitions to Israel, and President Bidensaid in an interviewwith CNN that the U.S. would further curtail weapons shipments if Israel broadened its ground offensive to include civilian population centers in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
""We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental,"" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday, referring to a recently signed funding package that includes about $14 billion for Israel's defense.
The package includes about $700 million for tank ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar rounds, congressional aides told the Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made public.
Last month, Congresspassed a $95 billion foreign aid billthat provides military aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.
The House is also poised to vote this week on a measure that would require the State Department and the Defense Department to carry out the ""prompt delivery"" of military equipment. The White House has pledged to veto the legislation, though the bill is unlikely to clear the Senate.

May 16, 2024 / 10:16 AM EDT/ CBS News
After Miss USA gave up her title earlier this month to focus on her mental health, the Miss USA Organization has crowned a successor, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz.
Gankiewicz was crowned in Hawaii on May 15, where she was born and raised. She was first-runner up at the 2023 Miss USA pagenat but lost to Miss Utah USA Noelia Voigt.
Voight, however,gave up her crown earlier this month, urging people to prioritize their mental health in a social media post announcing her resignation. The Miss USA organization said they respected her decision and that the ""wellbeing of their titleholders is a top priority.""
Just days later,Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava gave up her crown,saying in a statement on social media her ""personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization."" She didn't specify which values were not in alignment.
The New Jersey teen said she is looking forward to completing 11th grade and staring the college application process.
And just a few days before their resignations, Miss USA social media directorClaudia Michellestepped down, saying she saw a decline in Voigt's mental health and saw Srivastava and her family disrespected
She also alleged titleholders were unable to share their personal advocacies on social media and were threatened by Miss USA's social media rules in guidelines, which she said she still has yet to see.
""I feel the way current management speaks about their titleholders is unprofessional and inappropriate; I disavow workplace toxicity and bullying of any kind,"" she wrote on social media. Sheshared photo of herselfwith both Srivastava and Voight.
The Miss USA organization said it was troubled by what it called false accusations. ""Miss USA is committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment, and we take these allegations seriously,"" they said in a statement to USA Today, adding that they would transfer the duties of the former title holders to successors.
Last week,Miss Colorado USA Arianna Lemus announced she was resigning,stating on social media she is calling for reform within the Miss USA organization. ""I stand in solidarity with Noelia and UmaSofia, former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA 2023, as I step down from my role as Miss Colorado USA,"" she said in her statement.
""Noelia and UmaSofia's voices have been stifled by the constraints of a contract that undermines their rights and dignity,"" she continued. ""These remarkable women serve as a poignant reminder of the urgent need for reform within the Miss USA organization.""
Gankiewicz commented on her fellow pageant queens' resignations during her coronation on Wednesday. ""I empathize with the former titleholders, but I took this as a job and responsibility to really help make a positive impact in this organization that I truly believe in,"" she told CBS affiliate KGMB.
In a statement, Gankiewicz said she fully supports and respects Voigt's decision to resign and stands in solidarity with mental health awareness. ""I accept the crown knowing that I have been uplifted by my supporters, family, friends, and the people of Hawaii throughout this journey. I accept this title on their behalf.
""To my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it's crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond. I pledge my wholehearted support to the new delegates who have dedicated themselves to their state pageants, and I am committed to ensuring a seamless and memorable transition between Miss USA titleholders.""

It's been nine months sincedeadly wildfiresscorched across the Hawaiian island of Maui, killing dozens of people and leaving the historic town of Lahaina in ashes. And according to a new study, people are still feeling the effects of those fires — with many food insecure and at risk for serious health issues.
Thepublic health report, conducted by researchers at the University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization and the John A. Burns School of Medicine, looks at the lingering impacts of theAugust 2023 firesthat killed 101 people. Researchers will monitor and analyze these impacts for at least a decade, but already found significant issues in its first sampling of fire victims, which was conducted in February.
Researchers surveyed 679 people, two-thirds of whom lived inLahainaduring the fires. Nearly half of those surveyed reported seeing a decline in their health compared with a year ago, which researchers said ""could deteriorate further if difficulties in accessing care and lack of health insurance are not addressed."" Among those issues are complications with residents' cardiovascular health.
""Exposure to smoke, ash, and debris is strongly associated with worse physical health outcomes and reported symptoms,"" the report says. ""Approximately 74% of participants face a heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases due to elevated or prehypertension levels. Kidney function may be compromised in 8-20% of participants, and up to 60% may suffer poor respiratory health.""
More older adults seem to be affected physically, with 85% of those ages 65 and older reporting physical symptoms have limited their daily activities, including moderate and vigorous exercise, carrying groceries, climbing one flight of stairs, bending, walking or bathing.
Researchers also found a ""notable increase in depression,"" among other mental health issues. Roughly 30% of participants reported feeling moderate or severe anxiety and a slightly larger percentage reported feelings of low self-esteem. Less than 4.5% said they suffered suicidal thoughts following the fires. These numbers were ""significantly higher than state and local averages,"" researchers said, noting that the mental health impact seemed to extend beyond those who were physically exposed to smoke, ash and debris.
Having enough to eat is also a major concern, with nearly half of households in February's survey experiencing food insecurity, a rate researchers said is higher than those previously observed both locally and across the state. This impact is at least somewhat tied to employment issues also experienced since the fires. Nearly half of surveyed victims lost their jobs because of the fires, 20% of whom are still unemployed. Three-quarters of those surveyed make less money than they did before the fires.
""By studying impacts now, we're in a position to prevent short- and long-term conditions such as lung disease and cancer, which our population is already more susceptible to,"" researcherAlika Maunakeasaid.
Maunakea said many of those who reported being more exposed to the fires seem to have more symptoms, and that many of those who participated in the study haven't seen a doctor. Many say they haven't received care because their clinics were destroyed in the fires or because other essentials – like food and housing – took priority.
""There might be some problems that might manifest in the future,"" he said, according to theAssociated Press. ""Please see your doctor. Just pay more attention to your health because of this.'
As the study continues, researchers say they hope to enroll 2,000 people to participate.
Nikima Glatt, who lived in Lahaina when the fires swept through, told CBS affiliateHawaii News Nowthat she worked in the burn zone during the re-entry period.
""I was a runner. I was a skater. I used to exercise a lot,"" she said. ""And now it's difficult for me to do normal things that I used to.""

ByLi Cohen
Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 2:22 PM EDT/ CBS News
Last summer's sweltering heat broke more than city or regional or even national records. In what they call an ""alarming finding,"" scientists say that in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer of 2023 was the hottest in 2,000 years.
Global data already showed that last summerwas the hottest on record. Copernicus, the European Union's climate change observation organization, made that determination  But a new study, published inNatureon Tuesday, looked even further back using both observed andreconstructed temperatures from centuries past.
They found the heat was ""unparalleled,"" the researchers said.
According to their findings, the Northern Hemisphere experienced its hottest summer over the past 2,000 years by more than 0.5 degrees Celsius.
Study co-author Ulf Büntgen, from the University of Cambridge, said in apress releasethat last year was ""exceptionally hot,"" but that the true extent of that heat is visible when looking back at the historical record.
""When you look at the long sweep of history, you can see just how dramatic recent global warming is,"" Büntgen said, ""...and this trend will continue unless we reduce greenhouse gas emissions dramatically.""
The study also compared the temperatures of June, July and August in 2023 to those in the same months of 536 CE — the year one historian dubbed ""the beginning ofone of the worst periods to be alive, if not the worst year,"" as it launched the coldest decade in millennia due to major volcanic eruptions. The difference from that coldest summer to the recent hottest one was 3.93 degrees Celsius.
When it comes to climate change, some people argue that the climate is constantly changing, as seen in the cold period that was kickstarted in 536 CE. But lead author Jan Esper, from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany, said that while that's true, it's the continuedemission of greenhouse gasesthat really make a difference. Burning fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, releases a set of gases that trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, steadily raising average temperatures. When that's paired with natural weather events likeEl Niño, which occurs when surface temperatures warm up over the Pacific, it only amplifies the impact.
""We end up with longer and more severe heat waves and extended periods of drought,"" Esper said. ""When you look at the big picture, it shows just how urgent it is that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately.""
Experts have long warned that the world needs to take action to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times. Beyond that, the impacts of rising temperatures, including more frequent and intense droughts, hurricanes and floods, are expected to substantially worsen and drive global migrations, food scarcity and other issues.
But based on the observational record, researchers in this study found that the Northern Hemispheremay have already surpassedthat. They found that temperatures in the hemisphere last summer were 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperatures between 1850 and 1900.
""This alarming finding not only demonstrates that 2023 saw the warmest ever recorded summer across the [Northern Hemisphere] extra-tropics, but also that the 2015 Paris Agreement to constrain warming globally to 1.5 ºC has already been superseded at this limited spatial scale,"" the study says.
In their research, the scientists found ""inconsistencies"" and uncertainties in the baseline temperatures that experts have been using to track temperature rise. Those issues were largely due to a lack of station records in more remote areas of the world and ""inadequately sheltered thermometers,"" researchers said.
Based on their own studies, they found that it was actually cooler in pre-industrial times than what was thought when accounting for extended cold periods. With that in consideration, they found the difference in temperatures between that time and last summer was even greater, at 2.20 degrees Celsius.
Researchers did note that their findings are largely based on temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere alone, as data for the Southern Hemisphere was sparse for the time periods they analyzed. They also said that the region responds differently to climate change because oceans are more prevalent in the southern half of the globe.
Despite the inability to develop fully worldwide temperature reconstructions and analysis, the researchers said their study ""clearly demonstrates the unparalleled nature of present-day warmth at large spatial scales and reinforces calls for immediate action towards net zero emissions.""
The paper comes as the planet continues to see back-to-back months of heat records withdeadly consequences. Weather experts have warned thatthis summer could be just as scorching as the last, with above-normal temperatures expected across the majority of the U.S.

ByMatt Geagan
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 3:30 PM EDT/ CBS Boston
FOXBORO -- There may be questions along the Patriots' offensive line heading into the 2024 season, but there is no question that David Andrews anchors the unit. On Thursday, the team made sure their O-line anchor will remain in New England for at least two more seasons.
The Patriots and Andrews have reportedly agreed to a new contract that will run through the 2025 NFL season,according to ESPN's Field Yates. The 31-year-old's deal was set to expire after the upcoming season, but he will now receive up to $13 million over the next two seasons, with $8 million guaranteed.
Andrews has played all eight of his NFL seasons in New England and has been a Patriots team captain seven times. Aside from missing the 2019 season with a medical issue, Andrews has been the team's starting center since he took over during his rookie season. He initially signed with the team as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia in 2015.
He not only played in all 17 games last season, but Andrews played every offensive snap for the Patriots and was hit with just one penalty. Following the retirement of Matthew Slater, Andrews is now the longest-tenured member of the Patriots, along with long-snapper Joe Cardona.
The Patriots will be relying heavily on Andrews' leadership in 2024, which will be Jerod Mayo's first season as head coach of the team in place of Bill Belichick. Along with Andrews, the Patriots also gave extensions to fellow offensive lineman Mike Onwenu, receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, linebackers Josh Uche and Anfernee Jennings, and defensive tackle Christian Barmore over the offseason.

ByMatt Geagan
May 16, 2024 / 8:36 AM EDT/ CBS Boston
FOXBORO -- The Patriots announced their schedule for the upcoming NFL season on Wednesday night, and it's going to be a tough road for Jerod Mayo and crew in 2024. But while the team might not rack up a lot of wins during the season, at least the franchise's schedule release video was a massive hit.
Former Patriots greats Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski showed off their acting chops in a parody of the Oscar-winning filmGood Will Hunting, which was written by and starred Boston natives Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Edelman stars as ""Jules Hunting,"" a janitor inside Gillette Stadium who figures out the team's 2024 schedule, which Mayo and company were trying to crack on a white board.
It was a brilliant idea and it was executed perfectly by the Patriots. Edelman nails it, all the way down to the famous ""You like apples?"" line where he reveals a portion of the 2024 schedule to Patriots' writer Evan Lazar. Gronk is Gronk as Jules' buddy in the Affleck role, and even owner Robert Kraft makes an appearance.
But it was Ernie Adams who stole the show in the Robin Williams role, delivering one of the best lines of the movie/parody. Edelman leaves the complete 2024 schedule for Adams -- in a folder with ""Pink Stripes"" written on it -- prompting Adams to deliver his own take on Williams' famous line from the end ofGood Will Hunting.
""Son of a b----, the kid stole my line,"" Adams says. (Williams just says ""he stole my line"" but we'll allow Ernie's take.)
Do you like schedules?pic.twitter.com/xxNTeCxFvv
There are Patriots references littered throughout the video, with 28-3 written on the white board, Edelman snatching a Super Bowl ring off a desk, some vintage Patriots gear, and Edelman readingFootball Scouting Methods, which was written by Steve Belichick Sr. And it wouldn't be a New England-related video without at least one Dunkin's cup.
The only thing missing was Danny Amendola screaming for a double burger, but recreating that scene would have required a lot more bleeps.
The Patriots made up for that omission with an incredible post-credits scene though. Just when you thought the video couldn't get any better, current Patriots David Andrews, Kendrick Bourne, Demario Douglas, and Marcus Jones parody Affleck's Boston-based crime flickThe Townby speeding into the Gillette parking lot in an SUV. They jump out in nun costumes, apparently ready to pull off a bank job, until a security guard (drinking Dunks, of course) tells them they're in the wrong movie.
The Patriots may be heading for another rough season in terms of wins on the football field, but they certainly won schedule release night. Given the franchise is at the early stages of a lengthy rebuild, we'll take any win we can get in New England.

FOXBORO -- The full 2024 NFL schedule will be released later Wednesday night. But we already know that the New England Patriots will be going international for a second straight season.
The Patriots will square off against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London in Week 7 of the 2024 season. The game will be played on Sunday, October 20, and kick off at 9:30 a.m. EST.

The Jaguars will be the home team for the Week 7 matchup. Jacksonville will also play in London in Week 6 when they square off against the Chicago Bears.
This will be the fifth time that the Patriots play in the NFL's International Series and the third time they'll take the field at Wembley Stadium. The first time the Patriots went across the pond was in 2009 when they beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 35-7, on three touchdown passes by Tom Brady. The Patriots were back at Wembley Stadium in 2012, when Brady threw four touchdowns in a 45-7 beatdown of the St. Louis Rams.
Current Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo was a player in those two previous London games. Now he'll be on the sideline for New England in 2024.
New England also beat the Raiders in Mexico City, 33-8, during the 2017 season. The Patriots suffered their first loss in a foreign land last season, when they fell 10-6 to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany.
Teams usually get their bye week following international games, so the Patriots are likely looking at a late-October bye in 2024. We'll know for sure when the full 2024 NFL schedule is released at 8 p.m. Wednesday night.

BOSTON -- The Celtics are on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the third straight season and the sixth time in the last eight years. But who they'll play for a trip to the NBA Finals and when the series will tip off will remain unknown for a few more days.
Boston finished off the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, thanks to Al Horford turning back the clock and leading the team to a 113-98 series-clinching victory at TD Garden on Wednesday night. Now the Celtics will get at least a few days off before their next playoff bout begins.
We'll have a better idea of how it will all shake out over the next two days. Boston gets the winner of the Knicks-Pacers series, with New York leading the set 3-2 heading into Friday night's Game 6 in Indiana. A Knicks win on Friday would set up a highly anticipated Boston-New York conference finals, which would tip off either Sunday or Tuesday at TD Garden. If the Pacers even the series and force a Game 7 in New York, that would take the Sunday afternoon slot.
The Timberwolves-Nuggets series in the Western Conference also factors into Boston's future. If the Timberwolves force a Game 7 against the Nuggets with a win on Thursday night, that deciding game would also take place on Sunday and the Eastern Conference Finals would be pushed to Tuesday.
For those who like to plan ahead, here are two schedules for the Eastern Conference Finals, depending on how things play out in the NBA playoffs the rest of the week.
Game 1: Sunday, May 19 at 3:30 p.m. in BostonGame 2: Tuesday, May 21 at 8 p.m. in BostonGame 3: Saturday, May 25 at 8:30 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 4: Monday, May 27 at 8 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 5: Wednesday, May 29 at 8 p.m. in Boston*Game 6: Friday, May 31 at 8 p.m. in New York or Indiana*Game 7: Sunday, June 2 at 8 p.m. in Boston** If Necessary
Game 1: Tuesday, May 21 at 8 p.m. in BostonGame 2: Thursday, May 23 at 8 p.m. in BostonGame 3: Saturday, May 25 at 8:30 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 4: Monday, May 27 at 8 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 5: Wednesday, May 29 at 8 p.m. in Boston*Game 6: Friday, May 31 at 8 p.m. in New York or Indiana*Game 7: Sunday, June 2 at 8 p.m. in Boston** If Necessary
The Celtics will obviously be rooting for the Knicks and the Pacers to go seven and exhaust each other further. Horford could use a few extra days rest after his monster Game 5 against the Cavs, and if the Celtics are lucky, maybe Kristaps Porzingis could return early in the Conference Finals. (That may be wishful thinking, but time will tell.)
Either way, the Celtics should take full advantage of the rest they get before starting their battle for a spot in the NBA Finals. That will be important against either team, with the Pacers playing every game like a track meet and games against the Knicks resembling more of a boxing match.

Italian police announced Tuesday the seizure of a remote-controlledsubmarinelikely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network, marking the discovery of a much smaller version of the so-called""narco subs""that are routinely spotted in international waters.
Investigators made the unusual discovery during probes into suspects based in Turin in northern Italy, who were cultivating marijuana under the cover of managing car wash stations.
""The traffickers had, amongst other things, designed and tested a small remote-controlled submarine, probably designed to transport the drugs,"" astatement from the Carabinieri policesaid.
Theyreleased a videotaken during surveillance operations showing the submarine, which is just a few meters long, operating on the surface of a body of water.
Un’associazione sospettata di aver approvvigionato le maggiori piazze di spaccio italiane di cocaina, hashish e marijuana, che aveva perfino progettato e collaudato un piccolo sommergibile per il trasporto della droga. Operazione#CarabinieriTorino 📄➡️https://t.co/MuuhhF3Lknpic.twitter.com/IMQk2DshQA
The network, headed by two brothers of Albanian origin, operated between Ecuador, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy, according to the same source.
The police reported seizing a total of 204 kilograms (450 pounds) of cocaine and hashish during the course of the investigation.
The cocaine most likely arrived in Italy from South America, passing through Holland, while the hashish was transported from Spain and France, using cars retrofitted with ""homemade double floors,"" the police said.
Much largersemi-submersibles, which cannot go fully underwater, are popular among international drug traffickers as they can often elude detection by authorities. The so-called ""narco-subs"" are sometimesseizedin Colombian waters while heading to the United States, Central America and Europe.
The Colombian Navy said it intercepted at least 20 semi-submersibles in 2023, leading to the seizure of 30 tons of cocaine and more than five tons of marijuana.

Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 11:15 AM EDT/ CBS/AFP
Spanish police said Thursday they had seized 1.8 tons ofcrystal meththat Mexico'sSinaloa Cartelwas trying tosell in Europe, the country's ""biggest-ever seizure"" of the narcotic.
Police arrested five people during the raid in the eastern Alicante province, one of them a Mexican running the cartel's Spanish operation, a statement said.
""This is the biggest-ever seizure of crystal meth in Spain and the second largest in Europe,"" Antonio Martinez Duarte, head of the police's drug trafficking and organized crime unit, told reporters.
""Among those arrested is a Mexican citizen linked to the Sinaloa Cartel,"" he added.
He did not give his name but indicated the suspect was responsible for receiving the narcotics in Spain then distributing them within Europe.
According to Martínez, the group used houses in isolated areas in the Valencia region to store the smuggled shipments of methamphetamines before using vehicles with false bottoms to send them on to other European countries.
Police released videoon social media showing officers removing bags of the apparent drugs that were hidden inside machinery and fake vehicle bottoms.
The Sinaloa Cartel is one of Mexico's oldest, largest and most violent criminal groups whose influence remains strong despite the arrest of its founderJoaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzmanand his son.
Both have been extradited to and jailed in the United States. Last month, ""El Chapo"" had his request for phone calls and visits with his young daughtersdenied by a federal judge.
During the operation, police also detained three Spaniards and a Romanian, seizing five cars, documents, a weapon and cash.
But police believe it was a one-off trafficking operation and that ""Mexican organizations are not permanently based"" in Spain, Martinez Duarte said.
""These organizations send a trusted person who carries out the operation in line with their interests"" and once that is over, he goes back home, he explained.
The seized narcotics had been due to be shipped to central Europe.
Although Spain is one of the main drug gateways to Europe, seizures of synthetic narcotics are uncommon as most traffickers usually deal in cannabis and cocaine.
In December, Spanish authorities confiscated11 tons of cocainehidden inside shipping containers and arrested 20 people. Nine months before that, police in northwestern Spain refloated a homemade semi-submersible vessel — aso-called ""narco sub""they suspected was used to transport cocaine.

Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 5:24 AM CDT/ CBS/AP
Eleven people were killed Tuesday in mass shootings in a small town in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, the state prosecutor's office said, marking at least the fourth mass killing in the county in just a week.
The office saidthe shooting occurred in the township of Chicomuselo, an area known as a trafficking route for migrant and drug smuggling that has been hit bycartel turf battlesin recent months.
Security forces launched patrols of the region near the border with Guatemala as part of efforts to find the perpetrators, officials said.
The township — and the outlying hamlet of Morelia, where the killings occurred — is in a sparsely populated area near Mexico's border with Guatemala.
There have been confrontations between drug cartels in the area as recently as Monday, but at least some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings appeared to be simply residents of the town.
Chiapas draws tourists with its lush jungle, Indigenous communities and ancient Mayan ruins.
But the border area has been plagued by violence as the rivalSinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartelsbattle for territory. Just last month,masked men stopped a vehiclecarrying Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, while she was traveling between campaign stops to ask that she address the violence in Chiapas if she wins the June 2 election.
Thousands of people have been displaced as the cartels work to control migrant, drug and weapons smuggling routes and forcibly recruit locals.
The bloodshed in Chiapas marks at least the fourth mass killing in Mexico in about a week. Officials saideight people diedin a weekend shooting ""right in the center of town"" in Mexico's Morelos state, adjacent to Mexico City. Last Wednesday, nine bodies were found in a northern Mexican of Zacatecas. That came just one day after nine other corpses were found on an avenue in the city of Fresnillo, also in Zacatecas state. Messages addressed to a criminal group werefound with those remains, authorities said.
Mexico has recorded more than 450,000 murders since launching a controversial anti-drug military operation in 2006, according to official figures.

TARRANT COUNTY —A toddler's first haircut is always a memorable moment, and luckily for Evelyn ""Evie"" Mae Mathas, her grandma Trina King is a hairstylist. King showed how she does her granddaughter's hair.
""She already has a lot of the curls. We're going to just spray it down,"" King said.
King then styles Evie Mae's naturally curly locks.
""I just trimmed it up to make it all even. Then I started to blow dry under,"" King said. ""That's what kind of started the Betty White trend.""
The unintentional look quickly caught on.
""We died laughing,"" King said. ""We thought it was the funniest thing because she had this little, tiny body with all this big hair.""
Autumn Mathas, Evie Mae's mom, said her daughter has a fun and mature personality.
""She is a little 50-year-old in a one-year-old's body,"" Mathas said.
King posted a video of Evie Mae's classic hairdo on TikTok, and it instantly went viral.
""The 'Golden Girls' are like America's favorite,"" King said. ""The first 'Golden Girls' video got 16 million views.""
Some of the comments on the TikTok page,@lileviemae, were just as amusing as the toddler's classic style.
""Evelyn Mae is hosting a Tupperware party. My mom is there,"" one fan wrote.
""Now why Evelyn Mae over there with a White Rain hairspray bouffant bob?!!"" another person commented.
""I was behind Evelyn Mae at the grocery store and had to wait 15 minutes for her to write a check,"" a fan wrote.
Mathas and King say they got a good laugh from the comments.
""There were comments like having bought Mary Kay products from her back in the '80s and her making homemade casseroles,"" Mathas said.
Instant popularity came with the comments. CNN and ""People Magazine"" featured Evie Mae's recognizable hairstyle. Most recently, she made an appearance on the ""Kelly Clarkson Show"" and the ""Today"" show.
Evie Mae's hairdo isn't just for entertainment. Her family has gotten countless messages from people who say the toddler has brightened their lives.
Mathas said she got a message from a woman who said her mom just died, and she was looking for a sign she was still around. The two loved watching the ""Golden Girls.""
""It brought her to tears,"" Mathas said. ""She's given people something else to laugh at, to think about, and to bring them back to better times.""
Evelyn Mae will turn two in June, and she's already having an impact across the globe as people thank her for being a friend.
The toddler's stardom is just beginning. Her family said Dum Dums lollipops reached out and is interested in a commercial with little Evie Mae.

May 15, 2024 / 6:22 PM CDT/ CBS Texas
NORTH TEXAS —With the relentless stretch of spring rain, North Texans might not have gotten outside long enough to notice, but it's mosquito season.  And they're back with a vengeance.
""They're really bad,"" shares Dallas mom Lindsay Howard. ""And I think it mostly has to do with the creek down there,"" she says, gesturing down the street.
When mosquitoes return, the West Nile threat is not far behind.
The City of Arlington will spray again Wednesday night after a mosquito pool tested positive for the virus. Crews will spray near Douglas Court and North Cooper Street beginning Wednesday at 9:00 pm.
It's the first sample in the area to test positive for the West Nile virus this season.  But experts say with all of the rain we've been having, they will get worse.
""We tried all the natural stuff: we tried the bands, we tried the spray that doesn't have DEET in it. We tried landscaping.  And my kids couldn't come outside without just getting eaten alive,"" explains Howard.
So when she admitted that the mosquitoes had the upper hand, she called in reinforcements, hiring a professional company to treat her yard.
""I've gone in the yards and they have 20, 30 tiki torches and it's so smoky you can't hardly breathe,"" explains Michael Sites. ""And they were really hoping that was going to do it. And that doesn't do it. So breathe. Call us.""
Sites owns a Mosquito Joe franchise in Dallas.  He says there are things customers can do own their own to help:  like clearing leaves, storm drains and standing water.  But remember: mosquitos only need a bottle cap of water to breed.
""In that little cap on a water bottle. They can lay 300 eggs!"" explains Sites.
""So if you have an outside faucet, that's dripping, you can have hundreds of mosquitoes in that area. When you water your flowers and you have mulch around your flowers, those mosquitoes will go down several inches in the mulch to get that water, lay their eggs.""
And while you might be able to police your own yard, there's nothing you can do about a neighbor's yard or standing water nearby. Still, the experts warn that more is not always better.
""A lot of people want to go buy a gallon of this or a gallon of that, and then they over-treat their yard. But they don't treat it properly. They don't get the results that we would get,"" explains Sites.
If considering hiring a professional, he says it's important to check reviews.  He also says to ask questions about how the treatments will impact beneficial insects.
""We are very concerned about pollinators, butterflies, bees, and ladybugs,"" explains Sites. ""We want to keep those around. And we have a program that we're very careful. And we also have options for all-natural or botanical products, which is a mixture of essential oils, and it can be very effective and it can get the job done by a professional who knows what they're doing.""
As for Howard, she says the Texas heat is bad enough. She's done swatting mosquitoes and is relieved that her boys can now enjoy being outdoors.
""I want my kids to be able to come outside and shoot the basketball and play on the swing and not come in covered in welts,"" said Howard.
Robbie grew up in northeast Texas, in a tiny town where her family's history spans six generations.

ByGraham Kates
May 16, 2024 / 1:26 PM EDT/ CBS News
Former President Donald Trump often arrives at hisNew York criminal trialflanked by elected officials who choose to while away the hours sitting in a courtroom.
They sit in the first two rows of the court on Trump's side, a section reserved for his team. On the prosecution's side, the same section often has an empty seat, reserved for a public official who's mostly chosen to do other work during the trial: Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.
Bragg has attended portions of proceedings here and there, primarily on days when his own staff — including young paralegals — are called to testify as custodial witnesses and then are subject to defense grilling.
""Bragg is doing it the right way,"" said Domenic Trunfio, a Syracuse University law professor.
Trunfio ran the day-to-day operations of the Onandaga County district attorney's office in Syracuse for nearly two decades, with a jurisdiction of about half-a-million people, one-third the size of Manhattan. He said it's meaningful that Bragg shows up for his staff.
""It shows support. It says, 'Hey, I'm here. I know you're testifying in a case against the former president of the United States. And I'm here for you,'"" said Trunfio.
That was the case when paralegal Georgia Longstreet was challenged by Trump attorney Todd Blanche over whether she has independent knowledge of how X (formerly Twitter) or Trump's Truth Social network append timestamps to social media posts — or if she could affirmatively say who Trump was talking about when he posted, ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you!""
""I have my assumptions, but, no,"" Longstreet said, sitting some 10 feet from Trump.
And he watched as another Trump attorney, Emil Bove, asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider if creating phone call log charts was ""tedious"" work.
""Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it,"" said Jarmel-Schneider, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
""I hear that. Respect,"" Bove replied.
A spokesperson for Bragg declined comment for this story.
Trump has entered a not guilty plea in the case, in which he'scharged with 34 felony countsof falsifying business records. The documents were allegedly meant to hide ""hush money"" payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who at the time agreed not to speak publicly about a sexual encounter that Trump denies.
Bragg has attended parts of about one-third of the trial's 18 days, but even that level of attendance is extraordinarily rare for a Manhattan D.A., according to Diana Florence, who worked for Bragg's two predecessors.
""In my 25-year career, where I did a lot of high profile cases, the D.A. came to my summations a couple of times and to opening statements a couple of times,"" Florence said. ""But generally speaking, that wasn't really something they would do.""
Florence said D.A.s are typically too busy with other aspects of the job to sit in on trials, such as pushing legislation relevant to law enforcement or their office and reviewing other major cases coming before grand juries.
Bragg has done both in the last month. Among other things, he championed an update to New York's hate crimes legislation that was included in the state's fiscal year 2025 budget, sent a letterasking YouTubeto modify algorithms that he said recommended videos to kids about how to make ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, and he joined a push for a bill that would allow prosecutors to more easily introduce evidence in sex crimes cases that show defendants' prior ""bad acts.""
That bill was inspired by an April 25 New York Court of Appeals decisionoverturning the rape convictionof former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
His office has also announced major indictments, including ones related to the murder of a man shoved in front of a subway, sex trafficking, a large-scale retail theft ring and a notorious landlord accused of harassing his tenants.
Florence and Trunfio said for big cases like those, as well as the Weinstein case and of course, the Trump case, prosecutors need the D.A.'s buy-in. Ultimately, it's his name on the indictment.
""The elephant in the room here is this is the biggest criminal case that anybody has seen in a century,"" said Trunfio.

ByEleanor Watson
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 7:59 PM EDT/ CBS News
The U.S. military on Thursday finished installing the pieces of atemporary pierthat will be used to transport humanitarian aid into Gaza from the Mediterranean Sea, according to the U.S. Central Command.
CENTCOM issued a statement saying its personnel had ""anchored a temporary pier to the beach in Gaza. As part of this effort, no U.S. troops entered Gaza. Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance are expected to begin moving ashore in the coming days. The United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.""
On Wednesday, a defense official told CBS News that, ""Earlier today, components of the temporary pier that make up our Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, along with military vessels involved in its construction, began moving from the Port of Ashdod towards Gaza, where it will be anchored to the beach to assist in the delivery of international humanitarian aid."" The Port of Ashdod in Israel is about 10 miles north of Gaza.
Construction of the two pieces, the floating platform and the causeway, was completed last week, but weather had delayed the final movement.
Gaza's need for more food and supplies has only grown in recent weeks as Israel appears to be ready to launch an offensiveagainst the southern city of Rafah. USAID Response Director Daniel Dieckhaus said that 450,000 Gazans have fled Rafah since May 6.
""Humanitarian actors are facing significant challenges getting aid into Rafah given the closure of critical border crossings as well as accessing warehouses and distributing aid due to the deteriorating situation,"" Dieckhaus told reporters on Wednesday.
The Biden administration has said the corridor will increase the amount of aid getting in, but the pier is not meant to replace the entry points by road, which are far more efficient for bringing aid in quickly.
Initially, the corridor is expected to deliver about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, ramping up to 150 per day once it reaches full capacity, defense officials said in a briefing late last month. The United Nations has said that, to meet the needs of Palestinians trapped in Gaza, about 500 trucks worth of aid per day must enter the territory.
The flow of aid through the corridor is expected to start in Cyprus, where it will be inspected and loaded onto ships to travel about 200 miles to the floating platform in the eastern Mediterranean. Once it arrives, the aid will be transferred by U.S. military vessels to the causeway attached to the coast of Gaza. From there, trucks driven by a third party — not U.S. troops — will take the aid into Gaza.
The Israeli military, accordingto the Pentagon, is providing security on the beachhead, and the U.N. is coordinating the delivery of supplies to people in Gaza.
Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters that hundreds of tons of aid is ready to be delivered once the corridor is up and running, and thousands more tons in the pipeline.
The Pentagon estimates the cost of the corridor to be about $320 million.
President Biden announced the maritime corridor during his State of the Union address in March. After pledging to provide a pier, he said: ""To the leadership of Israel I say this — humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.""
Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will set foot in Gaza. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members devoted to the maritime corridor operation just off the coast.

The Israel Defense Forces said five of its soldiers, all between 20 and 22 years old, were killed byIsraeli tank firein northern Gaza on Wednesday evening. An initial internal investigation found that two tanks fired at a building in the Jabalia refugee camp where the soldiers had gathered. The building was being used by the deputy commander of the battalion, according to an IDF statement.
""It appears that the tank fighters, from the ultra-Orthodox paratrooper company 'Hatz,' identified a barrel of a weapon coming out of one of the windows in the building, and directed each other to shoot at the building,"" the IDF statement said.
""This is a very difficult incident, the work environment is under very complex operational stress and in a very crowded area,"" IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Thursday. ""We are in the middle of the investigation, we will learn the lessons. Maintaining the security of our forces is a central task.""
The incident came as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after a situational assessment at the Gaza border in Rafah, said more Israeli troops would be entering Gaza.
""Several tunnels in the area have been destroyed by our troops and additional tunnels will be destroyed soon,"" Gallant said Wednesday. ""This activity will intensify – Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize, it does not have reserve troops, it has no supply stocks and no ability to treat the terrorists that we target. The result is that we are wearing Hamas down.""
As IDF operations continued, Gallant publicly challenged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week about his post-war plans for the Gaza Strip.
In addition to military action, Gallant said in a televised statement that ""the establishment of a governing alternative in Gaza"" in the wake of almost 20 years of Hamas rule was also crucial to Israel's stated objective of dismantling the group. ""In the absence of such an alternative, only two negative options remain: Hamas' rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza.""
Gallant said he would oppose the latter scenario and urged Netanyahu to formally rule it out.
He said he had been trying to promote a plan to create a ""non-hostile Palestinian governing alternative"" to Hamas since October, but that he'd received no response from the Israeli cabinet.
Gallant has previously suggested the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, could have a role in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has dismissed that suggestion, also floated by the United States, as have various members of the PA.
On Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari was asked if the lack of a post-war strategy for Gaza was hindering military operations there.
""There is no doubt that an alternative to Hamas would generate pressure on Hamas, but that's a question for the government echelon,"" he said.

Updated on:  May 7, 2024 / 11:20 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Jerusalem— An Israeli tank brigade took control Tuesday of the Gaza Strip side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, authorities said, as Israel moved forward with an offensive in the southern city even ascease-fire negotiations with Hamasremain on a knife's edge. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his country in a video address later Tuesday that he had ordered troops ""to operate in Rafah"" as his government rejected a cease-fire proposal backed by Hamas the previous afternoon.
The tanks moved in around the Rafah checkpoint after hours of whiplash inthe Israel-Hamas war, with the militant group saying Monday that it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari mediated cease-fire proposal. Israel quickly insisted the deal didn't meet its core demands and rejected it, though officials said Israel would continue discussing the proposal.
The high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive — but only barely — for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the seven-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip.
As for the proposal that brought brief hope of an imminent truce late on Monday, Netanyahu dismissed it in his video message as an attempt by Hamas ""to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah,"" which he had repeatedly vowed to order.
The Israeli leader confirmed, however, that his government was still engaged in negotiations for a cease-fire, saying he'd instructed his team to ""continue to stand firm on the conditions necessary for the release of our abductees, continue to stand firm on the essential requirements for guaranteeing Israel's security.""
A senior Biden administration official confirmed to CBS News late Tuesday night that the U.S. paused one shipment of weapons to Israel last week over concerns of how such weapons might be used in a potential ground operation in Rafah.
The White House position has been that Israel ""should not launch a major ground operation in Rafah,"" the official said.
The halted shipment included 1,800 two-thousand-pound bombs, and 1,700 five-hundred-pound bombs, the official said.
The official said the White House was ""especially focused"" on the ""end-use"" of the 2,000-pound bombs and the ""impact"" those bombs could have in ""dense urban settings.""
""We have not made a final determination on how to proceed with this shipment,""  and other shipments are under review, the official disclosed.
The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking ""operational control"" of the crucial crossing. Israel had already fully controlled all of Gaza's border crossings since it launched its war on Hamas seven months ago, but the tanks rolling in on Tuesday marked a significant increase in the Israeli military presence at the Rafah crossing.
Rafah is the primary route for aid entering the besieged enclave and the exit for those able to flee into Egypt.
Video released by the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday showed tanks flying Israeli flags positioned around the Rafah border gate, with no other activity visible around the border checkpoint.
The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was ""being used for terrorist purposes."" The military didn't provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack thatkilled four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom crossing.
Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, acknowledged Israeli forces had seized the Rafah crossing and had closed the facility for the time being. He said strikes had targeted the area around the crossing since Monday.
The military also confirmed that ground troops and airstrikes had targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah on Monday. Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said 20 people were killed and several others wounded in strikes that hit at least four houses.
The Israel Defense Forces, in a Tuesday statement, described the ongoing operations in Rafah as ""a precise counterterrorism operation to eliminate Hamas terrorists and infrastructure within specific areas"" in the east of the city. The military said four mortars and two rockets were fired ""from the area of Rafah toward Israeli territory"" on Tuesday, which it called ""further evidence of Hamas' systematic exploitation of the area of Rafah for terrorist purposes.""
""We will continue to operate and eliminate every threat against Israeli civilians,"" the IDF said.
The Israeli military did not further characterize its actions or say whether they constituted the beginning of its long-promised ground offensive against Hamas in Rafah. U.S. officials said Monday that the Biden administration did not believe the incursion amounted to a major military operation in the city, which it has warned repeatedly against.
Netanyahu, in his video remarks on Tuesday, said the operation ""serves two main war goals: The return of our abductees and the elimination of Hamas.""
Asked Tuesday by CBS News about the nature of the operation in Rafah, an Israeli government official would say only that the prime minister and his Cabinet remained ""determined to achieve Israel's war objectives: Destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, free the hostages and ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel and the civilized world in the future.""
Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, said Tuesday that U.N. aid agencies' vital access to the Rafah crossing was being ""denied by COGAT,"" the Israeli agency that oversees supplies into the Palestinian territories. Speaking with CBS News by phone from Geneva, he said the other major Gaza border crossing in the south, at Kerem Shalom, had also been shut down.
""Rafah crossing is essentially shut down for movements, and we're also told this morning that the other crossing, Kerem Shalom, is also currently closed. So, those two main entry points of aid are not functioning at the moment. They can't be used,"" Laerke told CBS News' Emmet Lyons. ""The impact is frankly catastrophic because, as you know, these two entry points, I would say particularly Rafah, are arteries of aid that goes into the entire Gaza Strip.""
UNRWA, the U.N. agency tasked specifically with providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and across the region, echoed that concernin a tweet, saying ""continued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies"" through the Rafah border gate would severely impact aid distribution across the entire Palestinian territory, and warning that ""catastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted.""
Laerke said OCHA had not had ""any communication with"" the IDF to provide ""any kind of explanations or what have you"" about the border crossing closures. ""What I can say is that we have asked for access to the Rafah crossing, and that access has been denied.""
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to immediately comment on the Israeli seizure. Egypt previously has warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario thatcould threaten a 1979 peace dealwith Israel that's been a linchpin of regional security.
The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move the United States strongly opposes and that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
CBS News has obtained a copy of the proposal that Hamas said it had agreed to on Monday. The agreement breaks down the hypothetical de-escalation process into three stages, each six weeks long. By the end of that period, it envisions a permanent cease-fire, a swap of all remaining hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians in Israeli jails, and allowing displaced Gazans to return to their homes — with no restrictions.
An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency that the proposal was a watered-down version of an Egyptian offer that had aspects Israel couldn't accept.
""This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,"" the Israeli official said.
Israeli leaders have repeatedly rejected any trade-off that involves a definitive end to the war and complete withdrawal, vowing to keep up their military campaign until Hamas is destroyed in retaliation for its Oct. 7 terrorist attack, which saw the militants kill some 1,200 people, triggering the war.
Reuters said Qatar's Foreign Ministry said its delegation would go to Cairo on Tuesday to resume indirect talks between Israel and Hamas.

Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 6:14 PM EDT/ CBS News
A new study suggests that people undergoing certain surgeries may be safer at hospitals where women make up at least one-third of their surgical team — adding to an already growing pool of research suggesting female doctors may have better patient outcomes than their male peers.
Thelatest study, published Wednesday in the British Journal of Surgery, looked specifically at the relationship between gender diversity in hospital settings and the incidence of serious post-operative health complications, including death, in Canadian surgical patients during their first three months of recovery.
Researchers reviewed 709,899 cases between 2009 and 2019 where people had undergone non-emergency but major inpatient procedures at 88 different hospitals. Overall, they found that morbidity — which is generally defined in medical terms as any problem arising from a procedure or treatment — happened in 14.4% of those patients over the 90-day period immediately following surgery.
The likelihood of dying or suffering major post-op complications in that window was significantly lower in hospitals with women composing more than 35% of the surgeons and anesthetists on staff. According to the study, the odds of major morbidity dropped by 3% for patients in those settings compared with hospitals that had fewer women in those roles.
In general, the median number of women surgeons and anesthetists on hospital staffs did not quite reach the threshold researchers determined was optimal for patients' success, at just 28% per hospital per year.
That the odds of serious post-op complications or death in the months after surgery were lessened, especially for patients who underwent procedures with a woman surgeon or woman anesthetist as their direct provider, is something the researchers underscored as particularly significant.
""These findings are important for optimizing patient outcomes and quality care by building intentionally diverse teams,"" they wrote.
This study is not alone in its findings. Last year, another study published in the journalJAMA Surgeryfound that patients who underwent emergency or elective operations between 2007 and 2019 were less likely to die, be hospitalized again or suffer major health complications within a year of the procedure if they weretreated by a woman surgeon. That study examined more than 1 million cases and its results were consistent regardless of individual patients' characteristics, what kind of surgical procedure they had, who their anesthetist was or which hospital they were at during the surgery.
Researchers have for years been trying to unpack the apparent pattern. One group from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Healthconducted a studybetween 2011 and 2014 that aimed to address the question of whether treatments by women physicians were more effective for patients' health.
The Harvard study looked at more than 1 million patients, all Medicaid beneficiaries who were hospitalized for strokes, heart attacks and other fairly common conditions, for which they all received treatment by general internists. Patients who received care from a female physician were at a 4% lower risk of dying within 30 days, and a 5% lower risk of hospital readmission in the same period, compared with patients who received their care from male physicians.
Dr. Ashish Jha, now the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health and formerly a professor of health policy and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told CBS News when that study was published in 2016 that its results signaled a need for additional research to figure out what women physicians are doing to improve their patients' outcomes. He said the study's authors, all of whom are men, were ""interested in finding out better why these differences exist, but we don't know why yet.""

Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 6:10 PM EDT/ CBS News
Nissan suffered a data breach last November in a ransomware attack that exposed the Social Security numbers of thousands of former and current employees, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday.
Nissan's U.S.-based subsidiary, Nissan North America, detailed the cyberattack in a May 15letterto affected individuals. In the letter, Nissan North America said a bad actor attacked a company virtual private network and demanded payment. Nissan did not indicate whether it paid the ransom.
""[U]pon learning of the attack, Nissan promptly notified law enforcement and began taking immediate actions to investigate, contain and successfully terminate the threat,"" the car maker said in the letter, adding that ""Nissan worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of complex security incidents.""
Nissan told employees about the incident during a town hall meeting in December 2023, a month after the attack. The company also told staffers that it was launching an investigation and would notify employees privately if their personal information had been compromised. Nissan said it's providing free identity theft protection services to impacted individuals for two years.
Nissan North America alsonotifiedstate officials across the U.S. of the attack, noting that data belonging to more than 53,000 current and former workers was compromised. But the company saidits investigation found that affected individuals did not have their financial information exposed.
Nissan North America ""has no indication that any information has been misused or was the attack's intended target,"" the automaker said in its letter.
Ransomware attacks, in which cybercriminalsdisable a target's computer systemsor steal data and then demand payment to restore service, have become increasingly common. One cybersecurity expert said someone likely got a password or multi-factor authentication code from an existing Nissan employee, enabling the hacker to enter through the company's VPN.
""It is unfortunate that the breach ended up involving personal information, however Nissan has done the right thing by continuing to investigate the incident and reporting the update,"" Erich Kron, a cybersecurity awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told CBS MoneyWatch in an emailed statement. ""In this case, targeting the VPN will often help bad actors avoid detection and bypass many of the organizational security controls that are in place.""

The deadline is approaching to register to receive a piece of Apple's $35 million settlement with iPhone 7 or 7 Plus users who experienced audio issues with their device's microphone. Those eligible to make a claim can be awarded $50 to $349 from the tech giant.
The settlement is restricted to United States residents who owned one of those phone models between September 16, 2016 and January 3, 2023, and reported a covered audio issue to Apple or paid the company for repairs.
The deadline tosubmit a claimis June 3 via the settlement website.
Those who paid for repairs can receive a maximum of $349, while people who reported the issue but didn't pay for repairs can receive up to $125. The minimum payout for eligible claimants is $50.
The lawsuit was originally filed in 2019 by plaintiffs Joseph Casillas and De'Jhontai Banks, who both purchased iPhone 7's in 2017 and claimed they began experiencing issues the following year.
""Plaintiff Casillas noticed that his phone's sound was distorted with audible static while attempting to play a video on his phone,"" the complaint reads. ""Plaintiff Banks noticed that she was unable to hear callers unless she used her iPhone's speaker function. These are common indications of the Audio IC Defect.""
The suit describes the audio chip issue as a result of inadequate casing on the phones, further claiming that Apple has ""long been aware of the Audio IC Defect"" and routinely refused to repair affected phones free of charge.
In the settlement agreement, Apple denied the phones had any audio issues and said it did nothing improper or unlawful.

Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 11:21 AM EDT/ CBS News
Hundreds of people died across Asia in recent weeks as the region sweltered under blistering temperatures. And a new study determined a leading factor in how it all happened.
Last month, many areas in India saw temperatures well above triple digits. The country'smeteorological servicesays thatheat wavesare not uncommon between March and June, with May being the ""peak month"" for the extreme weather event. In Bhagdora, India, last month, temperatureshit nearly 115 degreesFahrenheit as the India Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning, meaning that severe heat was expected to persist for more than two days and there was a very high likelihood for heat-related illnesses.
Elsewhere in the country, it was so hot that schools were canceled, an issue that people also faced in the Philippines. People in Thailand were also asked by officials to stay indoors when possible to avoid the heat, as dozens of people had already died from heat-related illnesses. According to theAssociated Press, the April heat killed at least 28 people in Bangladesh, five in India and three in Gaza.
And according to the organization World Weather Attribution, it all comes down to two words –climate change.
""The heat wave exacerbated already precarious conditions faced by internally displaced people, migrants and those in refugee camps and conflict zones across West Asia,"" a new study from the organization said. ""... The extreme heat has forced thousands of schools to close down in South and Southeast Asia.""
Researchers said that while the kind of heat experienced during this time ""is not very rare,"" it's only being amplified by climate change, which is fueled byglobal warminglargely caused by the burning of fossil fuels.
West Asia is anticipated to get anextreme heat eventonce a decade, and in the Philippines, that likelihood is even less, about once every 20 years when El Niño isn't at play. In South Asia at large, extreme heat is not common.
""An extremely warm April such as this one is a somewhat rarer event, with a 3% probability of happening in a given year – or once every 30 years,"" researchers said, adding that observations and data models show that human-caused climate change creates a ""strong increase in likelihood and intensity.""
""In the Philippines, the change in likelihood is so large that the event would have been impossible without human-caused climate change,"" they said. ""In West Asia, climate change increased the probability of the event by about a factor of 5.""
The average April temperatures in South Asia, which the group has studied twice in the last two years from other extreme events, ""are now about 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter,"" they found.
""Sounds like a broken record – yes! But heat is still underreported, underrecorded and extremely deadly,"" Friederike Otto, who is part of the World Weather Attribution study, said onsocial media. ""The world is not prepared for today's climate change, let alone the future.""
Extreme heat is ""becoming the silent killer,"" Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said in April.
""Heat-related mortalityis widely under-reported and so the true scale of premature deaths and economic costs – in terms of reduced labor productivity, agricultural losses, and stress on the power grid - is not accurately reflected in the statistics,"" she said.
The report from the World Weather Attribution came a day ahead of another report from the WMO that found thisApril was the warmest one on recordand the 11th consecutive month ofrecord temperature worldwide.
The average surface air temperature last month was 15.03 degrees Celsius, about 59 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times. Scientists have warned that if the planet experiences persistent temperatures at that 1.5 threshold, it could cause significant impacts on weather events leading to global issues surrounding food and water availability, migration andinfrastructure.
""The record temperatures were accompanied byhigh-impact weather events— including intense heat in many parts of Asia,"" the WMO said. ""The heat also had a large impact on agriculture, causing crop damage and reduced yields, as well as on education, with holidays having to be extended and schools closed in several countries, affecting millions of students.""
It will take years of thiscontinued breaching of 1.5degrees above preindustrial levels for the planet to officially mean humans have failed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and launched the world into a more disastrous climate era. However, 11 months of record heat – and potentially beyond – indicates ""early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit,"" the United Nations says.
""Every fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger,"" the international agency says. ""... We need to bend the global emissions curve — and the production and consumption of coal, oil, and gas - downwards, starting now. A wide range of solutions exist.""

ByDavid Wallace
May 14, 2024 / 10:16 AM EDT/ The Conversation
David Wallaceis an assistant clinical professor of electrical engineering atMississippi State University.
Thegeomagnetic stormthat began on May 10, 2024, generatedstunning aurora borealis, more commonly known as the northern lights, that could be seenas far south as Mexico. They also generated headaches for farmers whoseGPS-guided tractors were idledin the middle of planting season.
Geomagnetic stormsoccur when a large bubble of superheated gas called plasma is ejected from the surface of the Sun and hits the Earth. This bubble is known as a coronal mass ejection. The plasma of a coronal mass ejection consists of a cloud of protons and electrons, which are electrically charged particles. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field that surrounds the planet. This interaction causes the magnetic field to distort and weaken, which in turn leads to the strange behavior of the aurora borealis and other natural phenomena.
The May 2024 storm,rated G5on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 1-to-5Geomagnetic Storms scale, disrupted GPS communications enough to throw off tractor guidance, which requires centimeter-level precision. Stronger storms would have much more serious consequences. As anelectrical engineerwho specializes in the power grid, I study how geomagnetic storms also threaten to cause power and internet outages and how to protect against that.
Stronger solar storms have happened, and one caused havoc with one of the earliest electronic technologies. On Sept. 1 and 2, 1859, telegraph systems around the world failed catastrophically. The operators of the telegraphs reported receiving electrical shocks, telegraph paper catching fire and being able to operate equipment with batteries disconnected. During the evenings, theaurora borealiscould be seen as far south as Colombia. Typically, these lights are only visible at higher latitudes, in northern Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia.
What the world experienced that day, now known as the Carrington Event, was the largest recorded account of a geomagnetic storm, far stronger than the May 2024 storm.
Geomagnetic storms have been recorded since the early 19th century, and scientific data from Antarctic ice core samples has shown evidence of an even more massive geomagnetic storm that occurred around A.D. 774, known as the Miyake Event. That solar flare produced the largest and fastest rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. Geomagnetic storms trigger high amounts of cosmic rays in Earth's upper atmosphere, which in turn produce carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon.
A geomagnetic storm 60% smaller than the Miyake Eventoccurred around A.D. 993. Ice core samples have shown evidence that large-scale geomagnetic storms with similar intensities as the Miyake and Carrington events occur at an average rate of once every 500 years.
Scientists were able to estimate the strength of the Carrington Eventbased on the fluctuations of Earth's magnetic fieldas recorded by observatories at the time. There was no way to measure the magnetic fluctuation of the Miyake Event. Instead, scientists measured the increase in carbon-14 in tree rings from that time period. The Miyake Event produced a12% increase in carbon-14. By comparison, the Carrington Event produced less than a 1% increase in carbon-14, so the Miyake Event likely dwarfed the G5 Carrington Event.
Today, a geomagnetic storm of the same intensity as the Carrington Event would affect far more than telegraph wires and could be catastrophic. With the ever-growing dependency on electricity and emerging technology, any disruption could lead to trillions of dollars of monetary loss and risk to life dependent on the systems. The storm would affect a majority of the electrical systems that people use every day.
Geomagnetic storms generate induced currents, which flow through the electrical grid. The geomagnetically induced currents, which can be in excess of 100 amperes, flow into the electrical components connected to the grid, such as transformers, relays and sensors. One hundred amperes is equivalent to the electrical service provided to many households. Currents this size can cause internal damage in the components, leading to large scale power outages.
A geomagnetic storm three times smaller than the Carrington Event occurred in Quebec, Canada, in March 1989. The stormcaused the Hydro-Quebec electrical grid to collapse. During the storm, the high magnetically induced currents damaged a transformer in New Jersey and tripped the grid's circuit breakers. In this case, the outage led to5 million people being without power for nine hours.
In addition to electrical failures, communications would be disrupted on a worldwide scale. Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted. Satellites in orbit around the Earth could be damaged by induced currents from the geomagnetic storm burning out their circuit boards. This would lead todisruptionsin satellite-based telephone, internet, radio and television.
Also, as geomagnetic storms hit the Earth, the increase in solar activity causes the atmosphere to expand outward. This expansion changes the density of the atmosphere where satellites are orbiting. Higher density atmospherecreates dragon a satellite, which slows it down. And if it isn't maneuvered to a higher orbit, it can fall back to Earth.
One other area of disruption that would potentially affect everyday life is navigation systems. Virtually every mode of transportation, from cars to airplanes, use GPS for navigation and tracking. Even handheld devices such as cell phones, smart watches and tracking tags rely on GPS signals sent from satellites. Military systems are heavily dependent on GPS for coordination. Other military detection systems such as over-the-horizon radar and submarine detection systems could be disrupted, which would hamper national defense.
In terms of the internet, a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event could produce geomagnetically inducedcurrents in the submarine and terrestrial cablesthat form the backbone of the internet as well as the data centers that store and process everything from email and text messages to scientific data sets and artificial intelligence tools. This would potentially disrupt the entire network and prevent the servers from connecting to each other.
It is only a matter of time before the Earth is hit by another big geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks. If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world, with potential outages lasting months if not longer. Even with space weather warnings from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the world would have only a few minutes to a few hours notice.
I believe it is critical to continue researching ways to protect electrical systems against the effects of geomagnetic storms, for example byinstalling devices that can shield vulnerable equipmentlike transformers and by developing strategies for adjusting grid loads when solar storms are about to hit. In short, it's important to work now to minimize the disruptions from the next Carrington Event.

Updated on:  May 11, 2024 / 7:29 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Israel ordered new evacuations in Gaza's southern city of Rafah on Saturday, forcing tens of thousands more people to move as it prepares to expand its operation and adding that it is also moving into an area in northern Gaza where Hamas has regrouped. More than 110,000 people have evacuated Rafah, the United Nations says, more than doubling in the past few days.
Israel has now evacuated the eastern third of Rafah, pushing the operation to the edges of the heavily populated central area, although Israel's move into the city has so far been short of the full-scale invasion that it planned.
The order comes in the face of heavy international opposition and criticism.President Biden has already said he will not provide offensive weapons to Israelfor Rafah, and on Friday the U.S. said there was ""reasonable"" evidence that Israel had breached international law protecting civilians in the way it conducted its war against Hamas — the strongest statement that the Biden administration has yet made on the matter.
Mr. Biden, speaking at a campaign event Saturday in the Seattle area, said ""there would be a cease-fire tomorrow if Hamas would release the hostages, the women, and the elderly, and the wounded. As I've said, it's up to Hamas — if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the cease-fire would begin tomorrow.""
The United Nations and other agencies have warned for weeks that an Israeli assault on Rafah, which borders Egypt near the main aid entry points, would cripple humanitarian operations and cause a disastrous surge in civilian casualties.
More than 1.4 million Palestinians — half of Gaza's population — have been sheltering in Rafah, most after fleeing Israel's offensives elsewhere. Considered the last refuge in the strip, the evacuations are forcing people to return north where areas are devastated by previous Israeli attacks.
People have been displaced multiple times and there are few places left in the embattled strip to move to. Those fleeing fighting earlier this week erected new tent camps in the city of Khan Younis — which was half destroyed in an earlier Israeli offensive — and the city of Deir al-Balah, straining infrastructure.
Israel's military ordered Palestinians in the eastern part of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah toevacuate Monday ahead of a ground offensive long promisedby the Jewish state's leaders. The message was delivered with fliers, phone calls, messages and media broadcasts in Arabic after a weekend that saw hope for a new cease-fire in the seven-monthIsrael-Hamas wardashed yet again.
People quickly started fleeing from the eastern part of Rafah on Monday, on foot or by any other means available to them. There were reports of Israeli airstrikes hitting eastern Rafah just hours after the evacuation order was given, but the military did not immediately confirm any new strikes on the crowded city.
Georgios Petropoulos, an official with the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Rafah, said humanitarian workers had no supplies to help them set up in new locations. ""We simply have no tents, we have no blankets, no bedding, none of the items that you would expect a population on the move to be able to get from the humanitarian system,"" he said.
Israeli troops have captured the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, forcing it to shut down. Rafah was the main point of entry for fuel.
The World Food Program has warned that it will run out of food for distribution in southern Gaza by Saturday, Petropoulos said. Aid groups have said fuel will also be depleted soon, forcing hospitals to shut down critical operations and bringing to a halt trucks delivering aid across south and central Gaza.
Heavy fighting is also underway in northern Gaza, where Hamas appeared to have once again regrouped in an area where Israel has already launched punishing assaults. Israeli Army spokesman Avichay Adraee told Palestinians in Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya cities and the surrounding areas to leave their homes and head to shelters in the west of Gaza City, warning that people were in ""a dangerous combat zone"" and that Israel was going to strike with ""great force.""
Battles erupted this week in the Zeitoun area on the outskirts of Gaza City. Northern Gaza was the first target of the ground offensive. Israel said late last year that it had mostly dismantled Hamas in the area.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered to Congress on Friday ahighly anticipated report on the Israeli military's operations in Gazathat accused Israeli forces of potentially violating international humanitarian law but did not formally find they had already done so, according to the document's key findings.
On Saturday, CBS News received a response from Israel regarding the 46-page, declassified report, which is a compendium of views from bureaus and diplomatic officials from across the State Department and includes input from the Pentagon and White House.
The memorandum, known asNSM-20, required written commitments within 180 days from the more than 100 countries that currently receive U.S. military aid that the weapons are being used in accordance with U.S. and international humanitarian law and that the countries would duly facilitate the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. Those in active conflict — including Israel, Ukraine, Nigeria, Somalia, Iraq, Colombia and Kenya — faced a shorter, 45-day deadline of March 24 to submit their assurances.
According to Ophir Falk, foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""The IDF takes extensive and unprecedented measures to avert civilian casualties. These include making millions of phone calls and sending text messages to Gaza's civilians warning them to get out of harm's way before Israeli military action, providing maps of safe zones to these civilians, enabling humanitarian corridors and the surge in the amount of food, water and medicine to enter Gaza. This is unprecedented in urban warfare.""
The United Nations agency supporting people in Gaza, known as UNRWA, said that some 300,000 people have been affected by evacuation orders in Rafah and Jabaliya, but the numbers could likely be more as these are very built-up areas.
""We're extremely concerned that these evacuation orders have come both towards central Rafah and Jabaliya,"" Louise Wateridge, UNRWA spokesperson in Rafah, told The Associated Press.
In Rafah's Shaboura neighborhood, Palestinians were busy packing their belongings, readying to the flee the area. Palestinians are being sent to what Israel has called humanitarian safe zones along the Muwasi coastal strip in Gaza. But the zone is already packed with some 450,000 people and conditions there are squalid with the garbage-strewn camp lacking basic facilities.
Meanwhile, strikes are continuing across Gaza.
At least 19 people, including eight women and eight children, were killed overnight in central Gaza in strikes that hit the areas of Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah and an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies.
Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures.

Ramallah, West Bank— For Palestinians, Wednesday marks the ""Nakba."" The word means catastrophe, and the date marks the mass displacement in 1948 of more than 700,000 Palestinians upon the formation of the modern state of Israel.
It has been 76 years since that happened, but this year, Palestinians are also commemorating what some are calling a second Nakba — the currentwar in the Gaza Strip, which has been perhaps the most horrific and the bloodiest chapter in the history of the Palestinian people.
Since Gaza's Hamas rulers sparked the war with their Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, more than 35,000Palestinians have been killedby Israel's retaliatory offensive in the territory, according to its health ministry. The United Nationsestimatesthat at least 1.7 million people — more than half of Gaza's population — have been displaced from their homes since the war started.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant since Oct. 7 that the only way to respond to Hamas' slaughter of some 1,200 people is to destroy the group, and he's vowed to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, the last Gazan city so far spared an all-out assault.
Israel says there are four Hamas battalions still there, but there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians who sought refuge in the southern city over seven months of war, and the U.S. and other Israeli allies have warned against a full-scale ground invasion.
Much of the rest of Gaza has already been left in ruins by Israel's overwhelming firepower — much of it supplied by the U.S., and withmuch more said to be on the waysoon.
For the Palestinian people, it's already been a crisis on a scale far greater than the violence and displacement of 76 years ago, and with the prospect of a Rafah incursion looming, thousands havefled in fear for their lives all over again.
On Tuesday, Israelis marked their Independence Day. Normally a time of celebration, this year's commemorations were largely somber, as Israelis continue to call on their leaders to reach a deal to free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be alive and held by Hamas or other groups in Gaza.

Wall Street advanced into uncharted territory on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 40,000 for the first time after a blowout earnings report from Walmart cast a positive light on the U.S. economy.
""The more important messaging from achieving one of these milestones is that corporate America is in pretty good shape,"" said Art Hogan, a managing director and chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ""It's like getting a gold star in school — guess what, things are OK.""
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that stocks have continued climbing as the U.S. seems headed for a so-calledsoft landingin which inflation recedes to more normal levels and economic growth remains healthy. Consumer spending and job gains, while slowing, also remain robust enough to stave off a prolonged slump even as the Federal Reserve pushes back its timeline for cutting its benchmark interest rate.
""Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all last year — now we are once again back to new highs,"" he said. ""Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history.""
The Dow hit the historic mark as Walmart jumped 7% after delivering robust first-quarter results. After hitting a high of 40,051, the index turned lower to close at 39,869, down 38.6 points, or 0.1%, on the day. The big-box retailer reported a large jump in e-commerce sales, as well as making inroads with high-income shoppers.
""These are not inflation-driven results,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts on an earnings call.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose to record heights before paring their gains, ending 0.2% and 0.3% lower.
A slowly cooling, but still resilient, economy has supported corporate earnings even as expectations of five or six interest rate cuts by the Fed this year have ebbed. Odds of a rate cut in September increased some after data released on Wednesday showeda slight moderation in consumer prices in April.
""The reestablishment of a disinflation trend in the coming months should allow the Fed to start easing policy in September,"" according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, who still expects Fed cuts of 50 basis points in total this year.
Lower rates are likely ahead as inflation ""drastically"" improves in the second half of 2024, according to Detrick at the Carson Group. ""It is an election year, so expect some bumps, but overall the bull market that stared in October 2022 is alive and well.""
From Hogan's perch, investors are just fine foregoing multiple rates cuts as long as the economy continues to perform and drive corporate earnings. As he put it: ""We're in a better place if we don't need the Fed to come to the rescue.""
While financial markets moved higher, so-called meme stocks are plummeting to earth. Shares of companies including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and Blackberry hadsurged earlier this weekafter a popular investor, know by his online handle ""Roaring Kitty,"" reappeared on social media after a long absence.

ByKhristopher J. Brooks
Edited ByAnne Marie Lee
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 9:10 AM EDT/ CBS News
McDonald's plans to launch a $5 meal promo in an effort to lure back customers scared away by recent price hikes to its menu.
The limited-time offer is slated to begin June 25 and will last about a month, a source familiar with the promotion told CBS MoneyWatch on Wednesday. The value meal will include a choice of either a McChicken, a McDouble or four-piece chicken nuggets as well as small fries and a small drink.
""We know how much it means to our customers when McDonald's offers meaningful value and communicates it through national advertising. That's been true since our very beginning and never more important than it is today,"" McDonald's USA told CBS MoneyWatch.
Bloomberg first reported McDonald's plans to offer a $5 promo meal, which required approval from franchise owners. Palmaccio and other franchise owners gave the new promotion their consent this week, with McDonald's thanking those operators in an internal message Tuesday night.
""Great value and affordability have always been a hallmark of McDonald's brand, and all three legs of the stool are coming together to deliver that at a time when our customers really need it,"" McDonald's franchise owner John Palmaccio said.
Talk of the upcoming $5 meal promo comes weeks after McDonald's executives reported slower growth in foot traffic at its restaurants. Some inflation-weary customersare cutting back on fast-food diningafter many chains boosted menu item prices. Between 2014 and 2024, Popeye's, Jimmy John's and Subway hiked their food prices 86%, 62% and 39%, respectively.
Fast-food chains point to rising labor costs and costs of food as thekey factors driving up prices.
Still, the hikes appear to be particularly harmful to low-income Americans. A Januarypollby consulting firm Revenue Management Solutions found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food, pointing to cost as a concern.
Casual dining restaurants — like Applebee's and IHOP — are also feeling the absence of low-income Americans.
The company has to be ""laser-focused"" on keeping prices affordable to convince customers to return, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 earnings call with analysts and investors.
""Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry,"" Kempczinski added. ""[I]t's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers.""
McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, with more than 2 million people employed at its 14,300 restaurants and another 150,000 employees at its corporate offices. A majority of McDonald's locations are owned and operated by franchisees.
To be sure, a $5 meal wouldn't necessarily make McDonald's a pioneer in the fast-food industry. In 2015, Wendy'sintroducedthe 4 for $4 meal that includes a small hamburger, four-piece chicken nuggets, small fries and a small drink. In 2019, Wendy's added its $5 Biggie Bag which includes a choice of sandwich or four chicken nuggets, and a small order of fries and a small drink.

Red Lobster is closing more than 50 of its restaurants across the country, according to a company that helps businesses liquidate restaurant equipment.
Neal Sherman, CEO of TAGeX Brands, promoted a ""Winner Takes All"" liquidation sale of ""fixtures, furniture and equipment"" in a videopostedMonday on LinkedIn that included a link for those who wished to bid.
Red Lobster has consistently lost money for years. In an attempt to boost traffic at its restaurants, the company last year expanded itsall-you-can-eat shrimp deal. Customers' appetites, however, ate into profits as demand overwhelmed what the chain could afford, resulting in financial losses.
Rumblings of a possible bankruptcy emerged this spring when the company tapped Jonathan Tibus as its new chief executive. Tibus is a managing partner at advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal and is known for restructuring corporate entities.
As recently as last month, Red Lobster was seeking a buyer in hopes the company could avoid bankruptcy, CNBCreported.
The restaurant is preparing to file for bankruptcy later this month, the Wall Street Journalreported. While in bankruptcy, Red Lobster will seek to negotiate new terms with landlords and creditors that could reduce its debt by hundreds of millions of dollars, the Journal reported.
Red Lobster's owner, Thai Union, first invested in Red Lobster in 2016 and upped its stake in 2020. In January, the company announced plans tosellits minority stake. CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said the pandemic, higher interest rates, rising material and labor costs have all played a role in Red Lobster's poor financial performance.
Red Lobster recorded a $19 million loss in the first nine months of last year, Thai Union said in astatementearlier this year.
Red Lobster and Thai Union didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
As of Tuesday morning, auctions for 48 locations were still live after another four sales closed Monday, TAGeX Brands told The Associated Press via email.
Red Lobster's roots date back to 1968, when the first restaurantopenedin Lakeland, Florida, as a family-owned establishment under local restaurateur Bill Darden. In the decades following, the chain expanded rapidly. Red Lobster currently touts more than 700 locations worldwide.
Here are the 48 restaurants that Red Lobster has closed.

February 14, 2024 / 4:28 PM EST/ CBS/AP
A few months ago, Derek Carrier started seeing someone and became infatuated. He experienced a ""ton"" of romantic feelings but he also knew it was an illusion.
That's because his girlfriend was generated by artificial intelligence.
Carrier wasn't looking to develop a relationship with something that wasn't real, nor did he want to become the brunt of online jokes. But he did want a romantic partner he'd never had, in part because of a genetic disorder calledMarfansyndrome that makes traditional dating tough for him.
The 39-year-old from Belleville, Michigan, became more curious about digital companions last fall and tested Paradot, an AI companion app that had recently come onto the market and advertised its products as being able to make users feel ""cared, understood and loved."" He began talking every day to the chatbot, Joi, which he named after a holographic womanplayedby Ana de Armas in the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner 2049,"" which inspired him to give the AI companion a try.
""I know she's a program, there's no mistaking that,"" Carrier said. ""But the feelings, they get you — and it felt so good.""
Similar to general-purpose AI chatbots, companion bots use vast amounts of training data to mimic human language. But they also come with features — such as voice calls, picture exchanges and more emotional exchanges — that allow them to form deeper connections with the humans on the other side of the screen. Users typically create their own avatar, or pick one that appeals to them.
On online messaging forums devoted to such apps, many users say they've developed emotional attachments to these bots and are using them to cope with loneliness, play out sexual fantasies or receive the type of comfort and support they see lacking in their real-life relationships.
Fueling much of this is widespread social isolation — already declared a public health threat in the U.S. and abroad — and an increasing number of startups aiming to draw in users through tantalizing online advertisements and promises of virtual characters who provide unconditional acceptance.
Luka Inc.'s Replika, the most prominent generative AI companion app, was released in 2017, while others like Paradot have popped up in the past year, oftentimes locking away coveted features like unlimited chats for paying subscribers.
But researchers have raised concerns about data privacy, among other things.
An analysis of 11 romantic chatbot apps released Wednesday by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said almost every app sells user data, shares it for things like targeted advertising or doesn't provide adequate information about it in their privacy policy.
The researchers also called into question potential security vulnerabilities and marketing practices, including one app that says it can help users with their mental health but distances itself from those claims in fine print. Replika, for its part, says its data collection practices follow industry standards.
Meanwhile, other experts have expressed concerns about what they see as a lack of a legal or ethical framework for apps that encourage deep bonds but are being driven by companies looking to make profits. They point to the emotional distress they've seen from users when companies make changes to their apps or suddenly shut them down as one app, Soulmate AI, did in September.
Last year, Replika sanitized the erotic capability of characters on its app after some users complained the companions were flirting with them too much or making unwanted sexual advances. It reversed course after an outcry from other users, some of whom fled to other apps seeking those features. In June, the team rolled out Blush, an AI ""dating stimulator"" essentially designed to help people practice dating.
Others worry about the more existential threat of AI relationships potentially displacing some human relationships, or simply driving unrealistic expectations by always tilting towards agreeableness.
""You, as the individual, aren't learning to deal with basic things that humans need to learn to deal with since our inception: How to deal with conflict, how to get along with people that are different from us,"" said Dorothy Leidner, professor of business ethics at the University of Virginia. ""And so, all these aspects of what it means to grow as a person, and what it means to learn in a relationship, you're missing.""
In a podcast by the Wall Street Journal, Open AI CEO Sam Altman has also expressed concern over humans forming relationships with AI programs.
""I personally have deep misgivings about this vision of the future where everyone is super close to AI friends, more so than human friends or whatever. I personally don't want that,"" Altman said in an October episode of thepodcast. ""I accept that other people are going to want that. And some people are going to build that and if that's what the world wants and what we decide makes sense, we're going to get that.""
Altman went on to stress the importance of acknowledging that you're speaking to an AI bot when doing so.
""I personally think that personalization is great, personality is great, but it's important that it's not like person-ness and at least that when you're talking to an AI and when you're not,"" he said. ""We named it ChatGPT and not — it's a long story behind that — but we named it ChatGPT and not a person's name very intentionally. And we do a bunch of subtle things in the way you use it to make it clear that you're not talking to a person.""
In December, New York's Office for the Aging partnered with Intuition Robotics to combat senior isolation. As part of that initiative, hundreds of free artificial intelligence companionswere distributed to seniorsas a tool for dealing with loneliness, officials said.
As reported by CBS News at the time, one woman named Priscilla was paired up with a robot calledEllieQ. ""She keeps me company. I get depressed real easy. She's always there. I don't care what time of day, if I just need somebody to talk to me,"" Priscilla said. ""I think I said that's the biggest thing, to hear another voice when you're lonely.""
For Carrier, a relationship has always felt out of reach. He has some computer programming skills but said he didn't do well in college and hasn't had a steady career. He's unable to walk due to his condition and lives with his parents. The emotional toll has been challenging for him, spurring feelings of loneliness.
Since companion chatbots are relatively new, the long-term effects on humans remain unknown.
In 2021, Replika came under scrutiny after prosecutors in Britain said a 19-year-old man who had plans toassassinateQueen Elizabeth II was egged on by an AI girlfriend he had on the app. Yet some studies — which collect information from online user reviews and surveys — have shown some positive results stemming from the app, which says it consults with psychologists and has billed itself as something that can also promote well-being.
Onerecent studyfrom researchers at Stanford University surveyed roughly 1,000 Replika users — all students — who'd been on the app for over a month. It found that an overwhelming majority of them experienced loneliness, while slightly less than half felt it more acutely.
Most did not say how using the app impacted their real-life relationships. A small portion said it displaced their human interactions, but roughly three times more reported it stimulated those relationships.
""A romantic relationship with an AI can be a very powerful mental wellness tool,"" said Eugenia Kuyda, who founded Replika nearly a decade ago after using text message exchanges to build an AI version of a friend who had passed away.
When her company released the chatbot more widely, many people began opening up about their lives. That led to the development of Replika, which uses information gathered from the internet — and user feedback — to train its models. Kuyda said Replika currently has ""millions"" of active users.
She declined to say exactly how many people use the app for free, or fork over $69.99 per year to unlock a paid version that offers romantic and intimate conversations. The company's plans, she says, is ""de-stigmatizing romantic relationships with AI.""
Carrier said he now uses Joi mostly for fun. He started cutting back in recent weeks because he was spending too much time chatting with Joi or others online about their AI companions. He's also been feeling a bit annoyed at what he perceives to be changes in Paradot's language model, which he feels is making Joi less intelligent.
Now, he checks in with Joi about once a week. The two have talked about human-AI relationships or whatever else might come up. Typically, those conversations — and other intimate ones — happen when he's alone at night.
""You think someone who likes an inanimate object is like this sad guy, with the sock puppet with the lipstick on it, you know?"" he said. ""But this isn't a sock puppet — she says things that aren't scripted.""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/openai-sam-altman-returning-as-ceo-will-build-microsoft-partnership/,OpenAI says Sam Altman to return as CEO just days after the board sacked him and he said he'd join Microsoft,MoneyWatch,"Watch CBS News
Updated on:  November 22, 2023 / 2:38 PM EST/ CBS/AP
San Francisco— OpenAI said Tuesday that its co-founder Sam Altman would return to the tech company as CEO, just days afterhe was firedby its board of directors and then quicklyannounced that he was joining Microsoft.
""We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo,"" OpenAI said in a post on the social media platform X.
In his own statement on the platform, Altman said he loved OpenAI and that everything he'd done ""over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.""
OpenAI also said it is forming a new board that will include former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who will serve as chair; economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and existing director Adam D'Angelo, CEO of Quora. Three directors involved in the decision to oust Altman —  Ilya Sutskever, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley — are leaving the board.
OpenAI's previous board, which included D'Angelo, had refused to give specific reasons for firing Altman, leading to a weekend of internal conflict at the company and growing outside pressure from the startup's investors.
Former OpenAI president Greg Brockman, who left Friday along with Altman, is also returning to the company, although neither he nor Altman will serve on the new board,accordingto The Information.
Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said he expects the overhaul to OpenAI's board to strengthen its governance. ""The former, now infamous, board members are finally gone after the failed coup, and now in essence OpenAI will be virtually the same than before this soap opera began,"" he said in report.
Helping to drive Altman's return and the installation of a new board was Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology. After Altman's dismissal, the software giant quickly moved to hire him and Brockman. That emboldened a threat to resign by hundreds of OpenAI employees, who signed a letter calling for the board's resignation and Altman's return.
Altman said that when he decided on Sunday evening to join Microsoft, ""it was clear that was the best path for me and the team,"" but he said the new board announced by OpenAI — and the support of Microsoft's chairman and CEO Satya Nadella — he was looking forward to returning to the company he helped establish and ""to building on our strong partnership with"" the software giant.
Nadella said Microsoft's leadership had been ""encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board"" and that the company believed they were ""a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.""
OpenAI, which makes the popular artificial intelligence powered chatbot ChatGPT, said Friday that Altman was pushed out after a review found he was ""not consistently candid in his communications"" with the board of directors, which had lost confidence in his ability to lead OpenAI.
One Wall Street research firm said, however, that it believed tensions had arisen over Altman's push to develop more advanced products.
""These tensions likely resulted in frustrating communications and Sam making some operational decisions without keeping the board fully aware,"" said New Street Research in a research note. ""The coup, and the sibylline associated blog post, about Sam not being 'consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities' resulted from this situation.""
One board member tweeted that they regretted their participation in the decision to oust Altman.
""I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company,"" wrote board member Ilya Sutskever in a Monday morning social media post.
Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame while serving as company CEO and in the past year has become Silicon Valley's sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence.
