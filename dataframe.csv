Ramallah, West Bank— For Palestinians, Wednesday marks the ""Nakba."" The word means catastrophe, and the date marks the mass displacement in 1948 of more than 700,000 Palestinians upon the formation of the modern state of Israel.
It has been 76 years since that happened, but this year, Palestinians are also commemorating what some are calling a second Nakba — the currentwar in the Gaza Strip, which has been perhaps the most horrific and the bloodiest chapter in the history of the Palestinian people.
Since Gaza's Hamas rulers sparked the war with their Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, more than 35,000Palestinians have been killedby Israel's retaliatory offensive in the territory, according to its health ministry. The United Nationsestimatesthat at least 1.7 million people — more than half of Gaza's population — have been displaced from their homes since the war started.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant since Oct. 7 that the only way to respond to Hamas' slaughter of some 1,200 people is to destroy the group, and he's vowed to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, the last Gazan city so far spared an all-out assault.
Israel says there are four Hamas battalions still there, but there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians who sought refuge in the southern city over seven months of war, and the U.S. and other Israeli allies have warned against a full-scale ground invasion.
Much of the rest of Gaza has already been left in ruins by Israel's overwhelming firepower — much of it supplied by the U.S., and withmuch more said to be on the waysoon.
For the Palestinian people, it's already been a crisis on a scale far greater than the violence and displacement of 76 years ago, and with the prospect of a Rafah incursion looming, thousands havefled in fear for their lives all over again.
On Tuesday, Israelis marked their Independence Day. Normally a time of celebration, this year's commemorations were largely somber, as Israelis continue to call on their leaders to reach a deal to free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be alive and held by Hamas or other groups in Gaza.

Ventura, Calif.— A judge decided Wednesday that a Southern California college professor will stand trial for involuntary manslaughter and battery in the death of a Jewish counter-protester during demonstrations overthe Israel-Hamas warlast year.
Superior Court Judge Ryan Wright judge declared after a two-day preliminary hearing that there's enough evidence to try Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji,according to the Ventura County District Attorney's Office.
Alnaji, 51, is accused of striking Paul Kessler with a megaphone in November during a confrontation at an event that started as a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Thousand Oaks, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles.
Kessler, 69, fell backward and struck his head on the pavement. He died the next day at a hospital.
Alnaji was charged with two felonies: involuntary manslaughter and battery causing serious bodily injury, with special allegations of personally inflicting great bodily harm injury on each count, the DA's office said. If found guilty of all charges, he could be sentenced to more than four years in prison.
Alnaji posted $50,000 bail. An Associated Press email and phone message for Alnaji's lawyer, Ron Bamieh, weren't immediately returned Wednesday.
Alnaji, a professor of computer science at Moorpark College, had espoused pro-Palestinian views on his Facebook page and other social media accounts, many of which were taken down in the days after Kessler's death,according to the Los Angeles Times.
The D.A.'s office says it ""continues to translate and review messages, social media postings, files, and documents belonging to Alnaji. This evaluation is ongoing and comprehensive, but to date it has not revealed evidence to support a hate crime. While antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by Alnaji.""

ByEleanor Watson
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 9:40 PM EDT/ CBS News
The U.S. military on Thursday finished installing the pieces of atemporary pierthat will be used to transport humanitarian aid into Gaza from the Mediterranean Sea, according to the U.S. Central Command.
CENTCOM issued a statement saying its personnel had ""anchored a temporary pier to the beach in Gaza. As part of this effort, no U.S. troops entered Gaza. Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance are expected to begin moving ashore in the coming days. The United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.""
On Wednesday, a defense official told CBS News that, ""Earlier today, components of the temporary pier that make up our Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, along with military vessels involved in its construction, began moving from the Port of Ashdod towards Gaza, where it will be anchored to the beach to assist in the delivery of international humanitarian aid."" The Port of Ashdod in Israel is about 10 miles north of Gaza.
Construction of the two pieces, the floating platform and the causeway, was completed last week, but weather had delayed the final movement.
Gaza's need for more food and supplies has only grown in recent weeks as Israel appears to be ready to launch an offensiveagainst the southern city of Rafah. USAID Response Director Daniel Dieckhaus said that 450,000 Gazans have fled Rafah since May 6.
""Humanitarian actors are facing significant challenges getting aid into Rafah given the closure of critical border crossings as well as accessing warehouses and distributing aid due to the deteriorating situation,"" Dieckhaus told reporters on Wednesday.
The Biden administration has said the corridor will increase the amount of aid getting in, but the pier is not meant to replace the entry points by road, which are far more efficient for bringing aid in quickly.
Initially, the corridor is expected to deliver about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, ramping up to 150 per day once it reaches full capacity, defense officials said in a briefing late last month. The United Nations has said that, to meet the needs of Palestinians trapped in Gaza, about 500 trucks worth of aid per day must enter the territory.
The flow of aid through the corridor is expected to start in Cyprus, where it will be inspected and loaded onto ships to travel about 200 miles to the floating platform in the eastern Mediterranean. Once it arrives, the aid will be transferred by U.S. military vessels to the causeway attached to the coast of Gaza. From there, trucks driven by a third party — not U.S. troops — will take the aid into Gaza.
The Israeli military, accordingto the Pentagon, is providing security on the beachhead, and the U.N. is coordinating the delivery of supplies to people in Gaza.
Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters that hundreds of tons of aid is ready to be delivered once the corridor is up and running, and thousands more tons in the pipeline.
The Pentagon estimates the cost of the corridor to be about $320 million.
President Biden announced the maritime corridor during his State of the Union address in March. After pledging to provide a pier, he said: ""To the leadership of Israel I say this — humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.""
Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will set foot in Gaza. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members devoted to the maritime corridor operation just off the coast.

The Biden administration has informed Congress that it intends to transfer $1 billion in weapons to Israel, two congressional sources confirmed to CBS News Tuesday.
Congress will need to approve the transfer. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news.
The move comes days after the U.S. withheld shipments of certain munitions to Israel, and President Bidensaid in an interviewwith CNN that the U.S. would further curtail weapons shipments if Israel broadened its ground offensive to include civilian population centers in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
""We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental,"" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday, referring to a recently signed funding package that includes about $14 billion for Israel's defense.
The package includes about $700 million for tank ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar rounds, congressional aides told the Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made public.
Last month, Congresspassed a $95 billion foreign aid billthat provides military aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.
The House is also poised to vote this week on a measure that would require the State Department and the Defense Department to carry out the ""prompt delivery"" of military equipment. The White House has pledged to veto the legislation, though the bill is unlikely to clear the Senate.

After Miss USA gave up her title earlier this month to focus on her mental health, the Miss USA Organization has crowned a successor, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz.
Gankiewicz was crowned in Hawaii on May 15, where she was born and raised. She was first-runner up at the 2023 Miss USA pagenat but lost to Miss Utah USA Noelia Voigt.
Voight, however,gave up her crown earlier this month, urging people to prioritize their mental health in a social media post announcing her resignation. The Miss USA organization said they respected her decision and that the ""wellbeing of their titleholders is a top priority.""
Just days later,Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava gave up her crown,saying in a statement on social media her ""personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization."" She didn't specify which values were not in alignment.
The New Jersey teen said she is looking forward to completing 11th grade and staring the college application process.
And just a few days before their resignations, Miss USA social media directorClaudia Michellestepped down, saying she saw a decline in Voigt's mental health and saw Srivastava and her family disrespected
She also alleged titleholders were unable to share their personal advocacies on social media and were threatened by Miss USA's social media rules in guidelines, which she said she still has yet to see.
""I feel the way current management speaks about their titleholders is unprofessional and inappropriate; I disavow workplace toxicity and bullying of any kind,"" she wrote on social media. Sheshared photo of herselfwith both Srivastava and Voight.
The Miss USA organization said it was troubled by what it called false accusations. ""Miss USA is committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment, and we take these allegations seriously,"" they said in a statement to USA Today, adding that they would transfer the duties of the former title holders to successors.
Last week,Miss Colorado USA Arianna Lemus announced she was resigning,stating on social media she is calling for reform within the Miss USA organization. ""I stand in solidarity with Noelia and UmaSofia, former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA 2023, as I step down from my role as Miss Colorado USA,"" she said in her statement.
""Noelia and UmaSofia's voices have been stifled by the constraints of a contract that undermines their rights and dignity,"" she continued. ""These remarkable women serve as a poignant reminder of the urgent need for reform within the Miss USA organization.""
Gankiewicz commented on her fellow pageant queens' resignations during her coronation on Wednesday. ""I empathize with the former titleholders, but I took this as a job and responsibility to really help make a positive impact in this organization that I truly believe in,"" she told CBS affiliate KGMB.
In a statement, Gankiewicz said she fully supports and respects Voigt's decision to resign and stands in solidarity with mental health awareness. ""I accept the crown knowing that I have been uplifted by my supporters, family, friends, and the people of Hawaii throughout this journey. I accept this title on their behalf.
""To my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it's crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond. I pledge my wholehearted support to the new delegates who have dedicated themselves to their state pageants, and I am committed to ensuring a seamless and memorable transition between Miss USA titleholders.""

It's been nine months sincedeadly wildfiresscorched across the Hawaiian island of Maui, killing dozens of people and leaving the historic town of Lahaina in ashes. And according to a new study, people are still feeling the effects of those fires — with many food insecure and at risk for serious health issues.
Thepublic health report, conducted by researchers at the University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization and the John A. Burns School of Medicine, looks at the lingering impacts of theAugust 2023 firesthat killed 101 people. Researchers will monitor and analyze these impacts for at least a decade, but already found significant issues in its first sampling of fire victims, which was conducted in February.
Researchers surveyed 679 people, two-thirds of whom lived inLahainaduring the fires. Nearly half of those surveyed reported seeing a decline in their health compared with a year ago, which researchers said ""could deteriorate further if difficulties in accessing care and lack of health insurance are not addressed."" Among those issues are complications with residents' cardiovascular health.
""Exposure to smoke, ash, and debris is strongly associated with worse physical health outcomes and reported symptoms,"" the report says. ""Approximately 74% of participants face a heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases due to elevated or prehypertension levels. Kidney function may be compromised in 8-20% of participants, and up to 60% may suffer poor respiratory health.""
More older adults seem to be affected physically, with 85% of those ages 65 and older reporting physical symptoms have limited their daily activities, including moderate and vigorous exercise, carrying groceries, climbing one flight of stairs, bending, walking or bathing.
Researchers also found a ""notable increase in depression,"" among other mental health issues. Roughly 30% of participants reported feeling moderate or severe anxiety and a slightly larger percentage reported feelings of low self-esteem. Less than 4.5% said they suffered suicidal thoughts following the fires. These numbers were ""significantly higher than state and local averages,"" researchers said, noting that the mental health impact seemed to extend beyond those who were physically exposed to smoke, ash and debris.
Having enough to eat is also a major concern, with nearly half of households in February's survey experiencing food insecurity, a rate researchers said is higher than those previously observed both locally and across the state. This impact is at least somewhat tied to employment issues also experienced since the fires. Nearly half of surveyed victims lost their jobs because of the fires, 20% of whom are still unemployed. Three-quarters of those surveyed make less money than they did before the fires.
""By studying impacts now, we're in a position to prevent short- and long-term conditions such as lung disease and cancer, which our population is already more susceptible to,"" researcherAlika Maunakeasaid.
Maunakea said many of those who reported being more exposed to the fires seem to have more symptoms, and that many of those who participated in the study haven't seen a doctor. Many say they haven't received care because their clinics were destroyed in the fires or because other essentials – like food and housing – took priority.
""There might be some problems that might manifest in the future,"" he said, according to theAssociated Press. ""Please see your doctor. Just pay more attention to your health because of this.'
As the study continues, researchers say they hope to enroll 2,000 people to participate.
Nikima Glatt, who lived in Lahaina when the fires swept through, told CBS affiliateHawaii News Nowthat she worked in the burn zone during the re-entry period.
""I was a runner. I was a skater. I used to exercise a lot,"" she said. ""And now it's difficult for me to do normal things that I used to.""

ByLi Cohen
Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 2:22 PM EDT/ CBS News
Last summer's sweltering heat broke more than city or regional or even national records. In what they call an ""alarming finding,"" scientists say that in the Northern Hemisphere, the summer of 2023 was the hottest in 2,000 years.
Global data already showed that last summerwas the hottest on record. Copernicus, the European Union's climate change observation organization, made that determination  But a new study, published inNatureon Tuesday, looked even further back using both observed andreconstructed temperatures from centuries past.
They found the heat was ""unparalleled,"" the researchers said.
According to their findings, the Northern Hemisphere experienced its hottest summer over the past 2,000 years by more than 0.5 degrees Celsius.
Study co-author Ulf Büntgen, from the University of Cambridge, said in apress releasethat last year was ""exceptionally hot,"" but that the true extent of that heat is visible when looking back at the historical record.
""When you look at the long sweep of history, you can see just how dramatic recent global warming is,"" Büntgen said, ""...and this trend will continue unless we reduce greenhouse gas emissions dramatically.""
The study also compared the temperatures of June, July and August in 2023 to those in the same months of 536 CE — the year one historian dubbed ""the beginning ofone of the worst periods to be alive, if not the worst year,"" as it launched the coldest decade in millennia due to major volcanic eruptions. The difference from that coldest summer to the recent hottest one was 3.93 degrees Celsius.
When it comes to climate change, some people argue that the climate is constantly changing, as seen in the cold period that was kickstarted in 536 CE. But lead author Jan Esper, from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany, said that while that's true, it's the continuedemission of greenhouse gasesthat really make a difference. Burning fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, releases a set of gases that trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, steadily raising average temperatures. When that's paired with natural weather events likeEl Niño, which occurs when surface temperatures warm up over the Pacific, it only amplifies the impact.
""We end up with longer and more severe heat waves and extended periods of drought,"" Esper said. ""When you look at the big picture, it shows just how urgent it is that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately.""
Experts have long warned that the world needs to take action to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times. Beyond that, the impacts of rising temperatures, including more frequent and intense droughts, hurricanes and floods, are expected to substantially worsen and drive global migrations, food scarcity and other issues.
But based on the observational record, researchers in this study found that the Northern Hemispheremay have already surpassedthat. They found that temperatures in the hemisphere last summer were 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the average temperatures between 1850 and 1900.
""This alarming finding not only demonstrates that 2023 saw the warmest ever recorded summer across the [Northern Hemisphere] extra-tropics, but also that the 2015 Paris Agreement to constrain warming globally to 1.5 ºC has already been superseded at this limited spatial scale,"" the study says.
In their research, the scientists found ""inconsistencies"" and uncertainties in the baseline temperatures that experts have been using to track temperature rise. Those issues were largely due to a lack of station records in more remote areas of the world and ""inadequately sheltered thermometers,"" researchers said.
Based on their own studies, they found that it was actually cooler in pre-industrial times than what was thought when accounting for extended cold periods. With that in consideration, they found the difference in temperatures between that time and last summer was even greater, at 2.20 degrees Celsius.
Researchers did note that their findings are largely based on temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere alone, as data for the Southern Hemisphere was sparse for the time periods they analyzed. They also said that the region responds differently to climate change because oceans are more prevalent in the southern half of the globe.
Despite the inability to develop fully worldwide temperature reconstructions and analysis, the researchers said their study ""clearly demonstrates the unparalleled nature of present-day warmth at large spatial scales and reinforces calls for immediate action towards net zero emissions.""
The paper comes as the planet continues to see back-to-back months of heat records withdeadly consequences. Weather experts have warned thatthis summer could be just as scorching as the last, with above-normal temperatures expected across the majority of the U.S.

BOSTON - TheMuseum of Sciencein Boston announced Tuesday that it will soon be undergoing a ""major renovation.""
The existing Cahners Theater will be transformed into a new venue called the ""Public Science Common."" The 10,000-square-foot area overlooking the Charles River is envisioned as a ""state-of-the-art convening space that will connect the public to Boston's unparalleled scientific community.""
Work will start this year and it is expected to finish in 2026. The museum didn't say how much it will cost, butBloomberg Philanthropieswill be a leading funder.
The Public Science Common space will be a multimedia venue capable of accommodating 700 people. It will allow for ""multiple programming in a single space,"" the museum says.
The new space will act as a hub for the museum's Center for Life Sciences, Center for the Environment and Center for Space Sciences initiatives.
""The Public Science Common will be common ground for everyone interested in science and technology,"" Museum of Science president Tim Ritchie said in a statement. ""It will be a place for people to bring their ideas and hopes, questions, and doubts. It will be a place where industry, academia, government, and the public can think out loud and solve problems together.""
The architect behind the new space, William Rawn Associates, has also worked on the redesign of the Boston Public Library's central branch and the Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood.
The project will also help the museum work toward its goal ofcarbon neutralityby 2035.

Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 3:30 PM EDT/ CBS Boston
FOXBORO -- There may be questions along the Patriots' offensive line heading into the 2024 season, but there is no question that David Andrews anchors the unit. On Thursday, the team made sure their O-line anchor will remain in New England for at least two more seasons.
The Patriots and Andrews have reportedly agreed to a new contract that will run through the 2025 NFL season,according to ESPN's Field Yates. The 31-year-old's deal was set to expire after the upcoming season, but he will now receive up to $13 million over the next two seasons, with $8 million guaranteed.
Andrews has played all eight of his NFL seasons in New England and has been a Patriots team captain seven times. Aside from missing the 2019 season with a medical issue, Andrews has been the team's starting center since he took over during his rookie season. He initially signed with the team as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia in 2015.
He not only played in all 17 games last season, but Andrews played every offensive snap for the Patriots and was hit with just one penalty. Following the retirement of Matthew Slater, Andrews is now the longest-tenured member of the Patriots, along with long-snapper Joe Cardona.
The Patriots will be relying heavily on Andrews' leadership in 2024, which will be Jerod Mayo's first season as head coach of the team in place of Bill Belichick. Along with Andrews, the Patriots also gave extensions to fellow offensive lineman Mike Onwenu, receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, linebackers Josh Uche and Anfernee Jennings, and defensive tackle Christian Barmore over the offseason.

New research is adding to the evidence linkingultra-processed foodsto health concerns. The study tracked people's habits over 30 years and found those who reported eating more of certain ultra-processed foods had a slightly higher risk of death — with four categories of foods found to be the biggest culprits.
For the study,published in The BMJ, researchers analyzed data on more than 100,000 U.S. adults with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Every four years between 1986 and 2018, the participants completed a detailed food questionnaire.
The data showed those who ate the most  ultra-processed food — about 7 servings per day — had a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, compared to participants who ate the lowest amount, a median of about 3 servings per day.
Ultra-processed foods include ""packaged baked goods and snacks, fizzy drinks, sugary cereals, and ready-to-eat or heat products,""a news releasefor the study noted. ""They often contain colors, emulsifiers, flavors, and other additives and are typically high in energy, added sugar, saturated fat, and salt, but lack vitamins and fiber.""
Foods with the strongest associations with increased mortality, according to the study, included:
Ultra-processed food is a ""very mixed group of very different foods,"" the lead author of the study, Mingyang Song,told CBS News, meaning these categories can offer a helpful distinction.
""Some of the foods actually have really beneficial ingredients like vitamins, minerals, so that's why we always recommend that people not focus too much on the (whole of) ultra-processed food, but rather the individual categories of ultra-processed food.""
The research included a large number of participants over a long timespan, but it did have some limitations. As an observational study, no exact cause-and-effect conclusions can be drawn. And the participants were health professionals and predominantly White and non-Hispanic, ""limiting the generalizability of our findings,"" the authors acknowledged.
But they wrote that the findings ""provide support for limiting consumption of certain types of ultra-processed food for long term health.""
""Future studies are warranted to improve the classification of ultra-processed foods and confirm our findings in other populations,"" they added.
This study comes after other research published earlier this year found diets high in ultra-processed food are associated with anincreased risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, including higher risk for cancer, major heart and lung conditions, gastrointestinal issues, obesity, type 2 diabetes, sleep issues, mental health disorders and early death.

The list of brands capitalizing on the trend keeps growing and already includes Lume, Secret, Dove, Old Spice and Native. Ads claim the products can be used from ""head to toe"" and even from ""pits to bits.""
But should you reach for all-body deodorants?
""It's not necessary at all,"" saysDr. Karan Lal, a double board certified dermatologist and member of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, based in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Dr. Afton Cobb, a dermatologist with Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in Jackson, Wyoming, says she doesn't recommend using deodorants all over your body. Instead, if you have any areas outside your armpits you want to target, you can try — with caution, she advises.
""That's a little bit more appropriate than just like all over the body,"" she says, acknowledging people may want a deodorant for feet or groin, for example. ""I don't agree with just like spraying a deodorant all over your entire body. But in those specific areas, I think there is some merit.""
Dr. Samer Jaber, a board-certified dermatologist at Washington Square Dermatology, in New York, agrees there is ""certainly no need to use deodorants in areas where you don't have odor,"" explaining that deodorants are basically perfumes that are sprayed on the body to mask body odor.
In statements to CBS News, Dove and Secret said they saw a demand for a full-body product.
""While some may view whole body deodorants as unnecessary, we at Dove know there is demand for this product. Unilever research found that 15% of Americans were looking for a full-body solution,"" said Pranav Chandan, U.S. head of deodorants at Unilever. ""Our research found that less than 1% of the sweat that our bodies produce comes from the underarm, so why not create a solution designed for use on all the other body parts that produce sweat?""
""We asked nearly 4000 people about their body odor and we found that: 50-60% of people are concerned about groin odor, 20-30% are concerned about chest or underbreast odor and 30-50% of people are concerned about foot odor,"" said Dr. Maiysha Jones, principal scientist for North America personal care at Procter & Gamble. ""Secret Whole Body Deodorant consulted with hundreds of gynecologists and dermatologists to review our formulas and safety research, and we learned that 4 out of 5 of each specialty would recommend whole body deodorant.""
CBS News has also reached out to Lume, which offers a range of whole-body deodorants, for comment.
Dermatologists said to be aware of a few things when it comes to these products — first, fragrance.
""Generally deodorants are very safe,"" Jaber says. ""The biggest issue potentially with deodorants is, if you have sensitive skin, fragrance can result in redness, itch and irritation.""
Lal says it's not just skin reactivity from fragrances, but also possible neurological reactivity, like migraines and headaches.
""There's a lot of fragrance in these things and... a lot of people are more fragrance sensitive than you imagine,"" he says. ""So you have to be very careful about using these types of products around certain people or yourself if you're someone that may be potentially fragrance sensitive.""
Other concerns include where it's being used, particularly in the groin area.
""For women, for example, if you're using things around the vaginal area, you potentially run the risk of messing up the microbiome in the vagina,"" Lal says. ""You have to be very careful with that, that you're not putting it too close and getting inside, which believe it or not, I'm sure people are doing.""
With any skincare product that you apply to an area that has that fine, delicate skin and is subject to moisture, Cobb says you ""run a higher risk of getting an irritant contact dermatitis,"" ordry, itchy, irritated areason the skin.
Secret, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, says it included gynecologists and dermatologists in safety testing to ensure its collection can be used on the skin around your ""most sensitive areas,"" but notes it's ""for external use only.""
It's actually a misconception that our sweat is what smells, dermatologists say.
""Our sweat does not smell when it leaves the body, for the most part. Unless you're eating certain foods or spices, it does not smell,"" Lal explains. ""When sweat comes out of your glands, there's certain bacteria on the skin that break the sweat down, which produces that type of odor.""
So, what are the best ways to decrease odor in armpits and elsewhere? There are three options, Jaber says:
Dermatologists say you can combat odor at the source by decreasing bacteria.
""For patients of mine with significant body odor, I recommend using (over-the-counter) antibacterial cleaning washes like Hibiclens or low-potency benzoyl peroxide washes in the shower, which can be very effective to decrease odor,"" Jaber says.
Lal says you can also combat body odor in sensitive areas like the armpits, groin, buttock and feet by using bodywashes with salicylic acid or glycolic acid.
""That will, over time, reduce the amount of bacteria on the skin so you don't make that body odor,"" he explains.
Topical antibiotics or medicines for certain malodorous conditions or excessive sweating can also be prescribed, Cobb says.
Beyond that, general behavioral measures can also help.
""Try to shower and rinse off. Try to really pad the areas dry and let them air out a lot so that you're minimizing that moist, occlusive environment. Changing out your shoes, changing out your socks, changing out your clothes, those kinds of things,"" Cobb suggests.
Dove says its whole-body deodorants are ""optimized to tackle odor at its source instead of just covering it up.""
""Our product targets odor at its source using a proprietary deodorizing agent to manage bacteria,"" Chandan said. ""Additionally, our creams and sticks help absorb unwanted moisture from sweat, further reducing the opportunity for odor to develop and helping to stop chafe.""
Secret says its whole-body deodorant was also designed to prevent odor at the source. ""Each form (spray, cream, stick) is made with a unique ingredient that fights odor-causing bacteria over time while being gentle on sensitive skin. The different forms give people flexibility in how and where to protect against body odor,"" Jones said.
Cobb recommends determining where the odor is coming from, as it might not be a result of sweating.
For groin smell, for example, is it actually coming from the surrounding skin?
""If you did have odor coming more vaginally, that might be a sign that you want to see a gynecologist to make sure there's nothing else going on,"" she says, warning that you ""wouldn't want to use an all-body deodorant in the vagina or vaginal mucosa.""
You could also be dealing with a different dermatological condition that causes odor, Lal explains, like hidradenitis suppurativa, where people get boils in their groin, armpits and under their breasts.
Other medical conditions can also be associated with certain odors, such as diabetes, liver disease and kidney disease, Cobb says, encouraging patients to seek professional help for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

Probiotic supplementsline store shelves, but should you be taking them?
Scientists' understanding ofprobiotic supplements is evolving. Once viewed as a useful daily dose of commercially manufactured mixtures meant to replicate thehealthy bacteria found inside our bodies, now some experts say these products might not be as helpful as once thought.
""Each probiotic is very specific and each person is very specific in terms of what they need, especially if they're having some GI symptoms caused by microbiome imbalance or dysfunction,"" says Dr. Aditya Sreenivasan, a gastroenterologist at Lenox Hill Hospital. And since a test doesn't yet exist to give someone an exact answer of what their gut may be lacking and what probiotic can help, it's ""really a trial and error situation,"" he says.
That's why he says he almost never tells people to stop taking them if they're finding some benefit from it, but also rarely advises people to start.
""If they're already taking something, and it has made some symptom get better, then great ... especially if you have like significant IBS that's not responding to (other options like)change in diet, trying probiotics is reasonable,"" he says. ""My caution about that is they're really expensive, and I feel like the majority of people end up just wasting their money.""
Dr. Shilpa Ravella, transplant gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, has also had patients who ""swear that probiotics make them feel better,"" but thinks supplements are best used to help with specific issues with a doctor's guidance.
""There are specific clinical scenarios in which probiotics are prescribed,"" she says, including things like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
But experts say to be mindful before using them.
While probiotics are safe for almost everyone, if you have certain health conditions, such as being immunocompromised, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, ""I would use them with caution,"" Sreenivasan says.
The Food and Drug Administration does not classify probiotic capsules as drugs, which means they do not have to be proven ""safe and effective,"" CBS News chief medical correspondentDr. Jon LaPook reported. When added to anything, probiotics only need to meet a lower standard: ""generally recognized as safe.""
Ravella says the best option is to talk to your gastroenterologist about a probiotic that could help you if you have a certain condition or symptoms.
But, if you're not having anyoutlying symptoms, she advises focusing instead on eating whole, plant foods tosupport your gut healthbefore reaching for supplements.

Elementary school cafeterias will be allowed to continue serving flavored milk such as chocolate and strawberry, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. The Biden administration had initially floated a ban aimed at cuttingconsumption of added sugarsby younger children.
The decision is one of several changes now locked in by the department's Food and Nutrition Service to its sweeping update to requirements that govern school meal programs. Firstproposedin February 2023, the updates are now set to take effect for the 2025 school year.
""School meals matter. In some cases, in many cases, in far too many cases, it is often the only meal or meals that youngsters may get during the day,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters Tuesday ahead of the announcement.
Vilsack said the department had fielded more than 136,000 comments on their initial proposal, which had been widelyhailed by public health expertsfor creating limits for the first time on added sugars and stepping up targets to reduce sodium.
However, some groups also voiced frustration with the department over some proposals they worried would bedifficult to meet.
""With no end in sight to supply chain and labor challenges, most school meal programs nationwide simply lack the capacity to meet these proposed nutrition mandates,"" the School Nutrition Associationsaidin comments last year on the proposal.
School districts making good-faith efforts to meet the new guidelines next year would not face financial penalties if they fell short, USDA officials pledged, though they disputed claims that most districts would not be able to meet the standards.
Department officials said the cost associated with the changes was ""very, very modest compared to the overall size of the program"" making up just around 1% of the bill footed by school food service programs over the coming years.
""The expectation and anticipation is, given the transition period that we have built into the rule, that we are going to see compliance. As has been indicated, the industry is already working on providing many of the products that will meet the standards,"" said Vilsack.
Some comments had also questioned whether some of the department's proposals to crack down onunhealthy ingredientscould backfire, encouraging more students to skip eating school lunch or swapping out for far more unhealthy options.
The USDA had proposed limiting flavored milk after ananalysisfound it was the largest source of added sugars in schools, making up around half in lunches from students drinking options like chocolate or strawberry-flavored milk instead of plain, unflavored versions.
That move would risk discouraging students from drinking milk altogether, somehealth expertsand thedairy industryargued, losing out on its nutritional benefits.
Vilsack said the USDA had worked with the dairy industry and credited milk producers for a pledge to reduce added sugar in school milk products.
In its release, the USDA said milk processors making up more than 90% of the nation's supply to schools had committed to reformulating their products to meet new added sugars limits on flavored milk.
""The challenge, I think, is to make sure that children have access and actually consume the milk. And I think most school nutrition officials would tell you that youngsters certainly gravitate towards the flavored milk option,"" said Vilsack.
Vilsack suggested some school districts might still elect not to serve chocolate and strawberry milk to come up with menus that fall under the new more stringent federal limits on added sugars overall in meals.
""We thought that it could fit within the decision making that would be made at the local level. Obviously it's a decision that each school district can make,"" he said.
The final rule also stops short of more ambitious sodium cuts the department had proposedphasing inuntil 2030, adding up to a 30% reduction in the amount that school lunches would have over the course of a week.
Instead, schools will only ""need to slightly reduce"" sodium in their breakfasts and lunches by Fall 2027.
""This change still moves our children in the right direction and gives schools and industry the lead time they need to prepare,"" the department said in its release.
A large reason for the change is Congress, Vilsack said, which intervened with a clause passed during the last budget process to decide this. The final changes will amount to only a 10% reduction in sodium across school breakfast meals and a 15% reduction in sodium across lunch meals.
""It's very consistent with the congressional directive,"" said Vilsack. ""In other words, Congress directed us to do this.""

More people are usingweight-loss medicationsto improve their health, including women who hope to lower the chances of complications when they become pregnant.
""Obesity and being overweightare definitely risk factors for multiple adverse outcomes in pregnancy,"" said Dr. Ilana Ramer Bass, an assistant professor in the division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at Mount Sinai Morningside and West in New York. She also leads the Mount Sinai Morningside Weight Loss Program.
Thoseincreased risk factorsinclude early spontaneous miscarriages and congenital abnormalities, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and cardiac dysfunction. Maternal obesity can also heighten difficulties with labor and postpartum recovery, Bass said.
""We do try to have people enter pregnancy at a healthier weight, and so having these medications gives us a tool to allow women to lose weight prior to conceiving,"" she said.
The Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding weight-loss drugs during pregnancy, and there is currently no data to support the use of the medications after conception.
Some of the popular drugs, including Ozempic and Mounjaro, were created tohelp diabeticsregulate their blood sugar. Other medications on the market, like Wegovy and Zepbound, are tools meant to help with weight management.
According to the most recentdatafrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. are considered obese. While the drugs are effective, patients mayexperience side effects. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea.
Bass said patients should stop using weight-loss medications two to three months before trying to conceive. That allows for a ""washout period"" that will flush the medications out of the body. If a woman accidentally becomes pregnant while taking a weight-loss medication, it is recommended she immediately go off the drug.
While weight-loss medications can be helpful for people who fit the description of their intended uses, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, which is behind Mounjaro, has released anew adcalling out people who use them for ""vanity.""
The Hollywood-themed ad lined up with the star-studded Oscars ceremony on Sunday night, saying ""it matters who gets"" the medications.High demandincreased by people looking to slim down hasled to shortages.
""I think these medications need to be used by the people who actually benefit from them,"" Bass said, ""and there's clearly a benefit for people who have obesity, or who have type 2 diabetes, and they should be used for those people.""

Another weight loss trend is making its roundson social media— this time in the form of a drink called ""oatzempic."" The name combines a reference to oats, one of the drink's ingredients, with a play onOzempic, the diabetes drug that's becomepopular for weight loss— even though there's no prescription medication involved.
Some TikTok users claim the drink — made with oats, water and lime juice — can help someone lose up to 40 pounds in as little as 2 months. Experts, however, say to be wary of any trend that promises to purge pounds fast.
Lisa Valente, a registered dietitian and nutrition editor atHealthline, calls the trend ""clever marketing for something that has no merit behind it.""
""Blended oat drinks are not the same as prescription drugs. It also seems like a dangerous trend that promotes disordered eating and isn't nutritionally sound or based in science,"" she told CBS News.
Maggie Evans, a registered dietitian and care specialist with virtual cardiometabolic care platform9amHealth, calls the trend an ""extreme measure.""
""As we've seen before, whether it'sMaster Cleanse, water fasts or other extreme diets, these (trends) may result in short-term weight loss results, but aren't the healthiest or most sustainable way to achieve that weight loss,"" she says.
TikTok has not blocked the term and hashtag (a step it appears to have taken for some other body image-relatedtrends like ""legging legs""), but when you search for ""oatzempic"" on the app, a banner appears saying ""you are more than your weight,"" with links to resources.
""Fast weight loss can be possible when you restrict calories significantly, and this drink is quite low in calories, so if you are using it as a meal replacement, it may lead to fast weight loss,"" Valente explains. ""However, I wouldn't recommend it because it is not a safe way to lose weight.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people who take the approach ofgradual, steady weight lossare more likely to keep the weight off than people who lose weight quickly.
""If a person stops the oatzempic diet, they're likely to regain the weight they lost and may end up in a yo-yo dieting cycle,"" says Dr. Avantika Waring, an endocrinologist and chief medical officer of 9amHealth. ""We know that medically, losing and regaining weight repeatedly can actually make sustaining a healthy weight harder.""
Waring says rapid weight loss can also result in:
""Underfueling the body can also lead to constipation, dehydration, dizziness and menstrual irregularities,"" she says.
Yes, oats are a heart-healthy whole grain that can be part of a balanced diet, experts say, and theirhigh fiber contentcan also help us feel satisfied and fuller longer. But they're no ""magic solution"" for weight loss.
""We don't have any data to suggest it is effective for weight loss, and it's likely that having a blended oat drink for breakfast would be as healthy as eating a bowl of oatmeal without added sugars or topped with just fresh fruit — which might also taste better!"" Waring says.
Plus, experts note the oatzempic drink is missing key nutrients like protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.
""There are other safer, healthier ways to lose weight that involve making small changes to your diet and don't remove entire foods or food groups,"" Valente says.
In general, false or misleading information can be rampant on social media. Experts say they've seen increased misinformation regarding weight loss in the past year, specifically related to the interest in drugs like Ozempic.
""Everything from'nature's Ozempic' — aka berberine, an ineffective and potentially dangerous supplement — to overblown, fear-inducing side effects like 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt,'"" Dr. James Wantuck, co-founder and chief medical officer of PlushCare,previously told CBS News.
Nutrition is also a nuanced topic, Valente adds, making it difficult to explain in a short, 10-second clip online.
""If you have questions about what you eat, I always recommend speaking with a health care professional rather than consulting social media,"" she says.

FOXBORO -- The Patriots announced their schedule for the upcoming NFL season on Wednesday night, and it's going to be a tough road for Jerod Mayo and crew in 2024. But while the team might not rack up a lot of wins during the season, at least the franchise's schedule release video was a massive hit.
Former Patriots greats Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski showed off their acting chops in a parody of the Oscar-winning filmGood Will Hunting, which was written by and starred Boston natives Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Edelman stars as ""Jules Hunting,"" a janitor inside Gillette Stadium who figures out the team's 2024 schedule, which Mayo and company were trying to crack on a white board.
It was a brilliant idea and it was executed perfectly by the Patriots. Edelman nails it, all the way down to the famous ""You like apples?"" line where he reveals a portion of the 2024 schedule to Patriots' writer Evan Lazar. Gronk is Gronk as Jules' buddy in the Affleck role, and even owner Robert Kraft makes an appearance.
But it was Ernie Adams who stole the show in the Robin Williams role, delivering one of the best lines of the movie/parody. Edelman leaves the complete 2024 schedule for Adams -- in a folder with ""Pink Stripes"" written on it -- prompting Adams to deliver his own take on Williams' famous line from the end ofGood Will Hunting.
""Son of a b----, the kid stole my line,"" Adams says. (Williams just says ""he stole my line"" but we'll allow Ernie's take.)
Do you like schedules?pic.twitter.com/xxNTeCxFvv
There are Patriots references littered throughout the video, with 28-3 written on the white board, Edelman snatching a Super Bowl ring off a desk, some vintage Patriots gear, and Edelman readingFootball Scouting Methods, which was written by Steve Belichick Sr. And it wouldn't be a New England-related video without at least one Dunkin's cup.
The only thing missing was Danny Amendola screaming for a double burger, but recreating that scene would have required a lot more bleeps.
The Patriots made up for that omission with an incredible post-credits scene though. Just when you thought the video couldn't get any better, current Patriots David Andrews, Kendrick Bourne, Demario Douglas, and Marcus Jones parody Affleck's Boston-based crime flickThe Townby speeding into the Gillette parking lot in an SUV. They jump out in nun costumes, apparently ready to pull off a bank job, until a security guard (drinking Dunks, of course) tells them they're in the wrong movie.
The Patriots may be heading for another rough season in terms of wins on the football field, but they certainly won schedule release night. Given the franchise is at the early stages of a lengthy rebuild, we'll take any win we can get in New England.

FOXBORO -- The full 2024 NFL schedule will be released later Wednesday night. But we already know that the New England Patriots will be going international for a second straight season.
The Patriots will square off against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London in Week 7 of the 2024 season. The game will be played on Sunday, October 20, and kick off at 9:30 a.m. EST.
Ready for the UK!The Patriots will face the Jaguars overseas in 2024.pic.twitter.com/xRT94giP5a
The Jaguars will be the home team for the Week 7 matchup. Jacksonville will also play in London in Week 6 when they square off against the Chicago Bears.
This will be the fifth time that the Patriots play in the NFL's International Series and the third time they'll take the field at Wembley Stadium. The first time the Patriots went across the pond was in 2009 when they beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 35-7, on three touchdown passes by Tom Brady. The Patriots were back at Wembley Stadium in 2012, when Brady threw four touchdowns in a 45-7 beatdown of the St. Louis Rams.
Current Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo was a player in those two previous London games. Now he'll be on the sideline for New England in 2024.
New England also beat the Raiders in Mexico City, 33-8, during the 2017 season. The Patriots suffered their first loss in a foreign land last season, when they fell 10-6 to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany.
Teams usually get their bye week following international games, so the Patriots are likely looking at a late-October bye in 2024. We'll know for sure when the full 2024 NFL schedule is released at 8 p.m. Wednesday night.

BOSTON -- The Celtics are on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the third straight season and the sixth time in the last eight years. Who they'll play for a trip to the NBA Finals remains unknown, but at least we know when the series will tip off.
Boston finished off the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, thanks to Al Horford turning back the clock and leading the team to a 113-98 series-clinching victory at TD Garden on Wednesday night. Now the Celtics will get a nice break before their next playoff bout begins.
Boston will face the winner of the Knicks-Pacers series, with New York leading the set 3-2 heading into Friday night's Game 6 in Indiana. Should the Pacers force a Game 7, that would take place Sunday in New York.
No matter what happens Friday night, the Eastern Conference Finals will tip off Tuesday in Boston. The Minnesota Timberwolves forced a Game 7 against the Denver Nuggets with a win on Thursday night, and that will take the Sunday spot in the NBA playoffs, regardless if the Knicks win or lose Friday night.
Game 1: Tuesday, May 21 at 8 p.m. in BostonGame 2: Thursday, May 23 at 8 p.m. in BostonGame 3: Saturday, May 25 at 8:30 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 4: Monday, May 27 at 8 p.m. in New York or IndianaGame 5: Wednesday, May 29 at 8 p.m. in Boston*Game 6: Friday, May 31 at 8 p.m. in New York or Indiana*Game 7: Sunday, June 2 at 8 p.m. in Boston** If Necessary
The Celtics will obviously be rooting for the Knicks and the Pacers to go seven and exhaust each other further. Horford could use a few extra days rest after his monster Game 5 against the Cavs, and if the Celtics are lucky, maybe Kristaps Porzingis could return early in the Conference Finals. (That may be wishful thinking, but time will tell.)
The Celtics should take full advantage of the rest they get before starting their battle for a spot in the NBA Finals. That will be important against either team, with the Pacers playing every game like a track meet and games against the Knicks resembling more of a boxing match.

Italian police announced Tuesday the seizure of a remote-controlledsubmarinelikely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network, marking the discovery of a much smaller version of the so-called""narco subs""that are routinely spotted in international waters.
Investigators made the unusual discovery during probes into suspects based in Turin in northern Italy, who were cultivating marijuana under the cover of managing car wash stations.

The police reported seizing a total of 204 kilograms (450 pounds) of cocaine and hashish during the course of the investigation.
The cocaine most likely arrived in Italy from South America, passing through Holland, while the hashish was transported from Spain and France, using cars retrofitted with ""homemade double floors,"" the police said.
Much largersemi-submersibles, which cannot go fully underwater, are popular among international drug traffickers as they can often elude detection by authorities. The so-called ""narco-subs"" are sometimesseizedin Colombian waters while heading to the United States, Central America and Europe.
The Colombian Navy said it intercepted at least 20 semi-submersibles in 2023, leading to the seizure of 30 tons of cocaine and more than five tons of marijuana.

Spanish police said Thursday they had seized 1.8 tons ofcrystal meththat Mexico'sSinaloa Cartelwas trying tosell in Europe, the country's ""biggest-ever seizure"" of the narcotic.
Police arrested five people during the raid in the eastern Alicante province, one of them a Mexican running the cartel's Spanish operation, a statement said.
""This is the biggest-ever seizure of crystal meth in Spain and the second largest in Europe,"" Antonio Martinez Duarte, head of the police's drug trafficking and organized crime unit, told reporters.
""Among those arrested is a Mexican citizen linked to the Sinaloa Cartel,"" he added.
He did not give his name but indicated the suspect was responsible for receiving the narcotics in Spain then distributing them within Europe.
According to Martínez, the group used houses in isolated areas in the Valencia region to store the smuggled shipments of methamphetamines before using vehicles with false bottoms to send them on to other European countries.
Police released videoon social media showing officers removing bags of the apparent drugs that were hidden inside machinery and fake vehicle bottoms.
The Sinaloa Cartel is one of Mexico's oldest, largest and most violent criminal groups whose influence remains strong despite the arrest of its founderJoaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzmanand his son.
Both have been extradited to and jailed in the United States. Last month, ""El Chapo"" had his request for phone calls and visits with his young daughtersdenied by a federal judge.
During the operation, police also detained three Spaniards and a Romanian, seizing five cars, documents, a weapon and cash.
But police believe it was a one-off trafficking operation and that ""Mexican organizations are not permanently based"" in Spain, Martinez Duarte said.
""These organizations send a trusted person who carries out the operation in line with their interests"" and once that is over, he goes back home, he explained.
The seized narcotics had been due to be shipped to central Europe.
Although Spain is one of the main drug gateways to Europe, seizures of synthetic narcotics are uncommon as most traffickers usually deal in cannabis and cocaine.
In December, Spanish authorities confiscated11 tons of cocainehidden inside shipping containers and arrested 20 people. Nine months before that, police in northwestern Spain refloated a homemade semi-submersible vessel — aso-called ""narco sub""they suspected was used to transport cocaine.

Eleven people were killed Tuesday in mass shootings in a small town in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas, the state prosecutor's office said, marking at least the fourth mass killing in the county in just a week.
The office saidthe shooting occurred in the township of Chicomuselo, an area known as a trafficking route for migrant and drug smuggling that has been hit bycartel turf battlesin recent months.
Security forces launched patrols of the region near the border with Guatemala as part of efforts to find the perpetrators, officials said.
The township — and the outlying hamlet of Morelia, where the killings occurred — is in a sparsely populated area near Mexico's border with Guatemala.
There have been confrontations between drug cartels in the area as recently as Monday, but at least some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings appeared to be simply residents of the town.
Chiapas draws tourists with its lush jungle, Indigenous communities and ancient Mayan ruins.
But the border area has been plagued by violence as the rivalSinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartelsbattle for territory. Just last month,masked men stopped a vehiclecarrying Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, while she was traveling between campaign stops to ask that she address the violence in Chiapas if she wins the June 2 election.
Thousands of people have been displaced as the cartels work to control migrant, drug and weapons smuggling routes and forcibly recruit locals.
The bloodshed in Chiapas marks at least the fourth mass killing in Mexico in about a week. Officials saideight people diedin a weekend shooting ""right in the center of town"" in Mexico's Morelos state, adjacent to Mexico City. Last Wednesday, nine bodies were found in a northern Mexican of Zacatecas. That came just one day after nine other corpses were found on an avenue in the city of Fresnillo, also in Zacatecas state. Messages addressed to a criminal group werefound with those remains, authorities said.
Mexico has recorded more than 450,000 murders since launching a controversial anti-drug military operation in 2006, according to official figures.

TARRANT COUNTY —A toddler's first haircut is always a memorable moment, and luckily for Evelyn ""Evie"" Mae Mathas, her grandma Trina King is a hairstylist. King showed how she does her granddaughter's hair.
""She already has a lot of the curls. We're going to just spray it down,"" King said.
King then styles Evie Mae's naturally curly locks.
""I just trimmed it up to make it all even. Then I started to blow dry under,"" King said. ""That's what kind of started the Betty White trend.""
The unintentional look quickly caught on.
""We died laughing,"" King said. ""We thought it was the funniest thing because she had this little, tiny body with all this big hair.""
Autumn Mathas, Evie Mae's mom, said her daughter has a fun and mature personality.
""She is a little 50-year-old in a one-year-old's body,"" Mathas said.
King posted a video of Evie Mae's classic hairdo on TikTok, and it instantly went viral.
""The 'Golden Girls' are like America's favorite,"" King said. ""The first 'Golden Girls' video got 16 million views.""
Some of the comments on the TikTok page,@lileviemae, were just as amusing as the toddler's classic style.
""Evelyn Mae is hosting a Tupperware party. My mom is there,"" one fan wrote.
""Now why Evelyn Mae over there with a White Rain hairspray bouffant bob?!!"" another person commented.
""I was behind Evelyn Mae at the grocery store and had to wait 15 minutes for her to write a check,"" a fan wrote.
Mathas and King say they got a good laugh from the comments.
""There were comments like having bought Mary Kay products from her back in the '80s and her making homemade casseroles,"" Mathas said.
Instant popularity came with the comments. CNN and ""People Magazine"" featured Evie Mae's recognizable hairstyle. Most recently, she made an appearance on the ""Kelly Clarkson Show"" and the ""Today"" show.
Evie Mae's hairdo isn't just for entertainment. Her family has gotten countless messages from people who say the toddler has brightened their lives.
Mathas said she got a message from a woman who said her mom just died, and she was looking for a sign she was still around. The two loved watching the ""Golden Girls.""
""It brought her to tears,"" Mathas said. ""She's given people something else to laugh at, to think about, and to bring them back to better times.""
Evelyn Mae will turn two in June, and she's already having an impact across the globe as people thank her for being a friend.
The toddler's stardom is just beginning. Her family said Dum Dums lollipops reached out and is interested in a commercial with little Evie Mae.

May 15, 2024 / 6:22 PM CDT/ CBS Texas
NORTH TEXAS —With the relentless stretch of spring rain, North Texans might not have gotten outside long enough to notice, but it's mosquito season.  And they're back with a vengeance.
""They're really bad,"" shares Dallas mom Lindsay Howard. ""And I think it mostly has to do with the creek down there,"" she says, gesturing down the street.
When mosquitoes return, the West Nile threat is not far behind.
The City of Arlington will spray again Wednesday night after a mosquito pool tested positive for the virus. Crews will spray near Douglas Court and North Cooper Street beginning Wednesday at 9:00 pm.
It's the first sample in the area to test positive for the West Nile virus this season.  But experts say with all of the rain we've been having, they will get worse.
""We tried all the natural stuff: we tried the bands, we tried the spray that doesn't have DEET in it. We tried landscaping.  And my kids couldn't come outside without just getting eaten alive,"" explains Howard.
So when she admitted that the mosquitoes had the upper hand, she called in reinforcements, hiring a professional company to treat her yard.
""I've gone in the yards and they have 20, 30 tiki torches and it's so smoky you can't hardly breathe,"" explains Michael Sites. ""And they were really hoping that was going to do it. And that doesn't do it. So breathe. Call us.""
Sites owns a Mosquito Joe franchise in Dallas.  He says there are things customers can do own their own to help:  like clearing leaves, storm drains and standing water.  But remember: mosquitos only need a bottle cap of water to breed.
""In that little cap on a water bottle. They can lay 300 eggs!"" explains Sites.
""So if you have an outside faucet, that's dripping, you can have hundreds of mosquitoes in that area. When you water your flowers and you have mulch around your flowers, those mosquitoes will go down several inches in the mulch to get that water, lay their eggs.""
And while you might be able to police your own yard, there's nothing you can do about a neighbor's yard or standing water nearby. Still, the experts warn that more is not always better.
""A lot of people want to go buy a gallon of this or a gallon of that, and then they over-treat their yard. But they don't treat it properly. They don't get the results that we would get,"" explains Sites.
If considering hiring a professional, he says it's important to check reviews.  He also says to ask questions about how the treatments will impact beneficial insects.
""We are very concerned about pollinators, butterflies, bees, and ladybugs,"" explains Sites. ""We want to keep those around. And we have a program that we're very careful. And we also have options for all-natural or botanical products, which is a mixture of essential oils, and it can be very effective and it can get the job done by a professional who knows what they're doing.""
As for Howard, she says the Texas heat is bad enough. She's done swatting mosquitoes and is relieved that her boys can now enjoy being outdoors.
""I want my kids to be able to come outside and shoot the basketball and play on the swing and not come in covered in welts,"" said Howard.
Robbie grew up in northeast Texas, in a tiny town where her family's history spans six generations.

ByGraham Kates
May 16, 2024 / 1:26 PM EDT/ CBS News
Former President Donald Trump often arrives at hisNew York criminal trialflanked by elected officials who choose to while away the hours sitting in a courtroom.
They sit in the first two rows of the court on Trump's side, a section reserved for his team. On the prosecution's side, the same section often has an empty seat, reserved for a public official who's mostly chosen to do other work during the trial: Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.
Bragg has attended portions of proceedings here and there, primarily on days when his own staff — including young paralegals — are called to testify as custodial witnesses and then are subject to defense grilling.
""Bragg is doing it the right way,"" said Domenic Trunfio, a Syracuse University law professor.
Trunfio ran the day-to-day operations of the Onandaga County district attorney's office in Syracuse for nearly two decades, with a jurisdiction of about half-a-million people, one-third the size of Manhattan. He said it's meaningful that Bragg shows up for his staff.
""It shows support. It says, 'Hey, I'm here. I know you're testifying in a case against the former president of the United States. And I'm here for you,'"" said Trunfio.
That was the case when paralegal Georgia Longstreet was challenged by Trump attorney Todd Blanche over whether she has independent knowledge of how X (formerly Twitter) or Trump's Truth Social network append timestamps to social media posts — or if she could affirmatively say who Trump was talking about when he posted, ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you!""
""I have my assumptions, but, no,"" Longstreet said, sitting some 10 feet from Trump.
And he watched as another Trump attorney, Emil Bove, asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider if creating phone call log charts was ""tedious"" work.
""Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it,"" said Jarmel-Schneider, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
""I hear that. Respect,"" Bove replied.
A spokesperson for Bragg declined comment for this story.
Trump has entered a not guilty plea in the case, in which he'scharged with 34 felony countsof falsifying business records. The documents were allegedly meant to hide ""hush money"" payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who at the time agreed not to speak publicly about a sexual encounter that Trump denies.
Bragg has attended parts of about one-third of the trial's 18 days, but even that level of attendance is extraordinarily rare for a Manhattan D.A., according to Diana Florence, who worked for Bragg's two predecessors.
""In my 25-year career, where I did a lot of high profile cases, the D.A. came to my summations a couple of times and to opening statements a couple of times,"" Florence said. ""But generally speaking, that wasn't really something they would do.""
Florence said D.A.s are typically too busy with other aspects of the job to sit in on trials, such as pushing legislation relevant to law enforcement or their office and reviewing other major cases coming before grand juries.
Bragg has done both in the last month. Among other things, he championed an update to New York's hate crimes legislation that was included in the state's fiscal year 2025 budget, sent a letterasking YouTubeto modify algorithms that he said recommended videos to kids about how to make ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, and he joined a push for a bill that would allow prosecutors to more easily introduce evidence in sex crimes cases that show defendants' prior ""bad acts.""
That bill was inspired by an April 25 New York Court of Appeals decisionoverturning the rape convictionof former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
His office has also announced major indictments, including ones related to the murder of a man shoved in front of a subway, sex trafficking, a large-scale retail theft ring and a notorious landlord accused of harassing his tenants.
Florence and Trunfio said for big cases like those, as well as the Weinstein case and of course, the Trump case, prosecutors need the D.A.'s buy-in. Ultimately, it's his name on the indictment.
""The elephant in the room here is this is the biggest criminal case that anybody has seen in a century,"" said Trunfio.

ByEleanor Watson
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 9:40 PM EDT/ CBS News
The U.S. military on Thursday finished installing the pieces of atemporary pierthat will be used to transport humanitarian aid into Gaza from the Mediterranean Sea, according to the U.S. Central Command.
CENTCOM issued a statement saying its personnel had ""anchored a temporary pier to the beach in Gaza. As part of this effort, no U.S. troops entered Gaza. Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance are expected to begin moving ashore in the coming days. The United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.""
On Wednesday, a defense official told CBS News that, ""Earlier today, components of the temporary pier that make up our Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, along with military vessels involved in its construction, began moving from the Port of Ashdod towards Gaza, where it will be anchored to the beach to assist in the delivery of international humanitarian aid."" The Port of Ashdod in Israel is about 10 miles north of Gaza.
Construction of the two pieces, the floating platform and the causeway, was completed last week, but weather had delayed the final movement.
Gaza's need for more food and supplies has only grown in recent weeks as Israel appears to be ready to launch an offensiveagainst the southern city of Rafah. USAID Response Director Daniel Dieckhaus said that 450,000 Gazans have fled Rafah since May 6.
""Humanitarian actors are facing significant challenges getting aid into Rafah given the closure of critical border crossings as well as accessing warehouses and distributing aid due to the deteriorating situation,"" Dieckhaus told reporters on Wednesday.
The Biden administration has said the corridor will increase the amount of aid getting in, but the pier is not meant to replace the entry points by road, which are far more efficient for bringing aid in quickly.
Initially, the corridor is expected to deliver about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, ramping up to 150 per day once it reaches full capacity, defense officials said in a briefing late last month. The United Nations has said that, to meet the needs of Palestinians trapped in Gaza, about 500 trucks worth of aid per day must enter the territory.
The flow of aid through the corridor is expected to start in Cyprus, where it will be inspected and loaded onto ships to travel about 200 miles to the floating platform in the eastern Mediterranean. Once it arrives, the aid will be transferred by U.S. military vessels to the causeway attached to the coast of Gaza. From there, trucks driven by a third party — not U.S. troops — will take the aid into Gaza.
The Israeli military, accordingto the Pentagon, is providing security on the beachhead, and the U.N. is coordinating the delivery of supplies to people in Gaza.
Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters that hundreds of tons of aid is ready to be delivered once the corridor is up and running, and thousands more tons in the pipeline.
The Pentagon estimates the cost of the corridor to be about $320 million.
President Biden announced the maritime corridor during his State of the Union address in March. After pledging to provide a pier, he said: ""To the leadership of Israel I say this — humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.""
Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will set foot in Gaza. There are about 1,000 U.S. service members devoted to the maritime corridor operation just off the coast.

The Israel Defense Forces said five of its soldiers, all between 20 and 22 years old, were killed byIsraeli tank firein northern Gaza on Wednesday evening. An initial internal investigation found that two tanks fired at a building in the Jabalia refugee camp where the soldiers had gathered. The building was being used by the deputy commander of the battalion, according to an IDF statement.
""It appears that the tank fighters, from the ultra-Orthodox paratrooper company 'Hatz,' identified a barrel of a weapon coming out of one of the windows in the building, and directed each other to shoot at the building,"" the IDF statement said.
""This is a very difficult incident, the work environment is under very complex operational stress and in a very crowded area,"" IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Thursday. ""We are in the middle of the investigation, we will learn the lessons. Maintaining the security of our forces is a central task.""
The incident came as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after a situational assessment at the Gaza border in Rafah, said more Israeli troops would be entering Gaza.
""Several tunnels in the area have been destroyed by our troops and additional tunnels will be destroyed soon,"" Gallant said Wednesday. ""This activity will intensify – Hamas is not an organization that can reorganize, it does not have reserve troops, it has no supply stocks and no ability to treat the terrorists that we target. The result is that we are wearing Hamas down.""
As IDF operations continued, Gallant publicly challenged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week about his post-war plans for the Gaza Strip.
In addition to military action, Gallant said in a televised statement that ""the establishment of a governing alternative in Gaza"" in the wake of almost 20 years of Hamas rule was also crucial to Israel's stated objective of dismantling the group. ""In the absence of such an alternative, only two negative options remain: Hamas' rule in Gaza or Israeli military rule in Gaza.""
Gallant said he would oppose the latter scenario and urged Netanyahu to formally rule it out.
He said he had been trying to promote a plan to create a ""non-hostile Palestinian governing alternative"" to Hamas since October, but that he'd received no response from the Israeli cabinet.
Gallant has previously suggested the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, could have a role in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has dismissed that suggestion, also floated by the United States, as have various members of the PA.
On Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari was asked if the lack of a post-war strategy for Gaza was hindering military operations there.
""There is no doubt that an alternative to Hamas would generate pressure on Hamas, but that's a question for the government echelon,"" he said.

Updated on:  May 7, 2024 / 11:20 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Jerusalem— An Israeli tank brigade took control Tuesday of the Gaza Strip side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, authorities said, as Israel moved forward with an offensive in the southern city even ascease-fire negotiations with Hamasremain on a knife's edge. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his country in a video address later Tuesday that he had ordered troops ""to operate in Rafah"" as his government rejected a cease-fire proposal backed by Hamas the previous afternoon.
The tanks moved in around the Rafah checkpoint after hours of whiplash inthe Israel-Hamas war, with the militant group saying Monday that it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari mediated cease-fire proposal. Israel quickly insisted the deal didn't meet its core demands and rejected it, though officials said Israel would continue discussing the proposal.
The high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive — but only barely — for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the seven-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip.
As for the proposal that brought brief hope of an imminent truce late on Monday, Netanyahu dismissed it in his video message as an attempt by Hamas ""to torpedo the entry of our forces into Rafah,"" which he had repeatedly vowed to order.
The Israeli leader confirmed, however, that his government was still engaged in negotiations for a cease-fire, saying he'd instructed his team to ""continue to stand firm on the conditions necessary for the release of our abductees, continue to stand firm on the essential requirements for guaranteeing Israel's security.""
A senior Biden administration official confirmed to CBS News late Tuesday night that the U.S. paused one shipment of weapons to Israel last week over concerns of how such weapons might be used in a potential ground operation in Rafah.
The White House position has been that Israel ""should not launch a major ground operation in Rafah,"" the official said.
The halted shipment included 1,800 two-thousand-pound bombs, and 1,700 five-hundred-pound bombs, the official said.
The official said the White House was ""especially focused"" on the ""end-use"" of the 2,000-pound bombs and the ""impact"" those bombs could have in ""dense urban settings.""
""We have not made a final determination on how to proceed with this shipment,""  and other shipments are under review, the official disclosed.
The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking ""operational control"" of the crucial crossing. Israel had already fully controlled all of Gaza's border crossings since it launched its war on Hamas seven months ago, but the tanks rolling in on Tuesday marked a significant increase in the Israeli military presence at the Rafah crossing.
Rafah is the primary route for aid entering the besieged enclave and the exit for those able to flee into Egypt.
Video released by the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday showed tanks flying Israeli flags positioned around the Rafah border gate, with no other activity visible around the border checkpoint.
The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was ""being used for terrorist purposes."" The military didn't provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack thatkilled four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom crossing.
Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, acknowledged Israeli forces had seized the Rafah crossing and had closed the facility for the time being. He said strikes had targeted the area around the crossing since Monday.
The military also confirmed that ground troops and airstrikes had targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah on Monday. Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said 20 people were killed and several others wounded in strikes that hit at least four houses.
The Israel Defense Forces, in a Tuesday statement, described the ongoing operations in Rafah as ""a precise counterterrorism operation to eliminate Hamas terrorists and infrastructure within specific areas"" in the east of the city. The military said four mortars and two rockets were fired ""from the area of Rafah toward Israeli territory"" on Tuesday, which it called ""further evidence of Hamas' systematic exploitation of the area of Rafah for terrorist purposes.""
""We will continue to operate and eliminate every threat against Israeli civilians,"" the IDF said.
The Israeli military did not further characterize its actions or say whether they constituted the beginning of its long-promised ground offensive against Hamas in Rafah. U.S. officials said Monday that the Biden administration did not believe the incursion amounted to a major military operation in the city, which it has warned repeatedly against.
Netanyahu, in his video remarks on Tuesday, said the operation ""serves two main war goals: The return of our abductees and the elimination of Hamas.""
Asked Tuesday by CBS News about the nature of the operation in Rafah, an Israeli government official would say only that the prime minister and his Cabinet remained ""determined to achieve Israel's war objectives: Destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, free the hostages and ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel and the civilized world in the future.""
Jens Laerke, the spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, said Tuesday that U.N. aid agencies' vital access to the Rafah crossing was being ""denied by COGAT,"" the Israeli agency that oversees supplies into the Palestinian territories. Speaking with CBS News by phone from Geneva, he said the other major Gaza border crossing in the south, at Kerem Shalom, had also been shut down.
""Rafah crossing is essentially shut down for movements, and we're also told this morning that the other crossing, Kerem Shalom, is also currently closed. So, those two main entry points of aid are not functioning at the moment. They can't be used,"" Laerke told CBS News' Emmet Lyons. ""The impact is frankly catastrophic because, as you know, these two entry points, I would say particularly Rafah, are arteries of aid that goes into the entire Gaza Strip.""
UNRWA, the U.N. agency tasked specifically with providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and across the region, echoed that concernin a tweet, saying ""continued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies"" through the Rafah border gate would severely impact aid distribution across the entire Palestinian territory, and warning that ""catastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted.""
Laerke said OCHA had not had ""any communication with"" the IDF to provide ""any kind of explanations or what have you"" about the border crossing closures. ""What I can say is that we have asked for access to the Rafah crossing, and that access has been denied.""
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to immediately comment on the Israeli seizure. Egypt previously has warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario thatcould threaten a 1979 peace dealwith Israel that's been a linchpin of regional security.
The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move the United States strongly opposes and that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
CBS News has obtained a copy of the proposal that Hamas said it had agreed to on Monday. The agreement breaks down the hypothetical de-escalation process into three stages, each six weeks long. By the end of that period, it envisions a permanent cease-fire, a swap of all remaining hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians in Israeli jails, and allowing displaced Gazans to return to their homes — with no restrictions.
An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency that the proposal was a watered-down version of an Egyptian offer that had aspects Israel couldn't accept.
""This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,"" the Israeli official said.
Israeli leaders have repeatedly rejected any trade-off that involves a definitive end to the war and complete withdrawal, vowing to keep up their military campaign until Hamas is destroyed in retaliation for its Oct. 7 terrorist attack, which saw the militants kill some 1,200 people, triggering the war.
Reuters said Qatar's Foreign Ministry said its delegation would go to Cairo on Tuesday to resume indirect talks between Israel and Hamas.

A new study suggests that people undergoing certain surgeries may be safer at hospitals where women make up at least one-third of their surgical team — adding to an already growing pool of research suggesting female doctors may have better patient outcomes than their male peers.
Thelatest study, published Wednesday in the British Journal of Surgery, looked specifically at the relationship between gender diversity in hospital settings and the incidence of serious post-operative health complications, including death, in Canadian surgical patients during their first three months of recovery.
Researchers reviewed 709,899 cases between 2009 and 2019 where people had undergone non-emergency but major inpatient procedures at 88 different hospitals. Overall, they found that morbidity — which is generally defined in medical terms as any problem arising from a procedure or treatment — happened in 14.4% of those patients over the 90-day period immediately following surgery.
The likelihood of dying or suffering major post-op complications in that window was significantly lower in hospitals with women composing more than 35% of the surgeons and anesthetists on staff. According to the study, the odds of major morbidity dropped by 3% for patients in those settings compared with hospitals that had fewer women in those roles.
In general, the median number of women surgeons and anesthetists on hospital staffs did not quite reach the threshold researchers determined was optimal for patients' success, at just 28% per hospital per year.
That the odds of serious post-op complications or death in the months after surgery were lessened, especially for patients who underwent procedures with a woman surgeon or woman anesthetist as their direct provider, is something the researchers underscored as particularly significant.
""These findings are important for optimizing patient outcomes and quality care by building intentionally diverse teams,"" they wrote.
This study is not alone in its findings. Last year, another study published in the journalJAMA Surgeryfound that patients who underwent emergency or elective operations between 2007 and 2019 were less likely to die, be hospitalized again or suffer major health complications within a year of the procedure if they weretreated by a woman surgeon. That study examined more than 1 million cases and its results were consistent regardless of individual patients' characteristics, what kind of surgical procedure they had, who their anesthetist was or which hospital they were at during the surgery.
Researchers have for years been trying to unpack the apparent pattern. One group from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Healthconducted a studybetween 2011 and 2014 that aimed to address the question of whether treatments by women physicians were more effective for patients' health.
The Harvard study looked at more than 1 million patients, all Medicaid beneficiaries who were hospitalized for strokes, heart attacks and other fairly common conditions, for which they all received treatment by general internists. Patients who received care from a female physician were at a 4% lower risk of dying within 30 days, and a 5% lower risk of hospital readmission in the same period, compared with patients who received their care from male physicians.
Dr. Ashish Jha, now the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health and formerly a professor of health policy and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told CBS News when that study was published in 2016 that its results signaled a need for additional research to figure out what women physicians are doing to improve their patients' outcomes. He said the study's authors, all of whom are men, were ""interested in finding out better why these differences exist, but we don't know why yet.""

Nissan suffered a data breach last November in a ransomware attack that exposed the Social Security numbers of thousands of former and current employees, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday.
Nissan's U.S.-based subsidiary, Nissan North America, detailed the cyberattack in a May 15letterto affected individuals. In the letter, Nissan North America said a bad actor attacked a company virtual private network and demanded payment. Nissan did not indicate whether it paid the ransom.
""[U]pon learning of the attack, Nissan promptly notified law enforcement and began taking immediate actions to investigate, contain and successfully terminate the threat,"" the car maker said in the letter, adding that ""Nissan worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of complex security incidents.""
Nissan told employees about the incident during a town hall meeting in December 2023, a month after the attack. The company also told staffers that it was launching an investigation and would notify employees privately if their personal information had been compromised. Nissan said it's providing free identity theft protection services to impacted individuals for two years.
Nissan North America alsonotifiedstate officials across the U.S. of the attack, noting that data belonging to more than 53,000 current and former workers was compromised. But the company saidits investigation found that affected individuals did not have their financial information exposed.
Nissan North America ""has no indication that any information has been misused or was the attack's intended target,"" the automaker said in its letter.
Ransomware attacks, in which cybercriminalsdisable a target's computer systemsor steal data and then demand payment to restore service, have become increasingly common. One cybersecurity expert said someone likely got a password or multi-factor authentication code from an existing Nissan employee, enabling the hacker to enter through the company's VPN.
""It is unfortunate that the breach ended up involving personal information, however Nissan has done the right thing by continuing to investigate the incident and reporting the update,"" Erich Kron, a cybersecurity awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told CBS MoneyWatch in an emailed statement. ""In this case, targeting the VPN will often help bad actors avoid detection and bypass many of the organizational security controls that are in place.""

The deadline is approaching to register to receive a piece of Apple's $35 million settlement with iPhone 7 or 7 Plus users who experienced audio issues with their device's microphone. Those eligible to make a claim can be awarded $50 to $349 from the tech giant.
The settlement is restricted to United States residents who owned one of those phone models between September 16, 2016 and January 3, 2023, and reported a covered audio issue to Apple or paid the company for repairs.
The deadline tosubmit a claimis June 3 via the settlement website.
Those who paid for repairs can receive a maximum of $349, while people who reported the issue but didn't pay for repairs can receive up to $125. The minimum payout for eligible claimants is $50.
The lawsuit was originally filed in 2019 by plaintiffs Joseph Casillas and De'Jhontai Banks, who both purchased iPhone 7's in 2017 and claimed they began experiencing issues the following year.
""Plaintiff Casillas noticed that his phone's sound was distorted with audible static while attempting to play a video on his phone,"" the complaint reads. ""Plaintiff Banks noticed that she was unable to hear callers unless she used her iPhone's speaker function. These are common indications of the Audio IC Defect.""
The suit describes the audio chip issue as a result of inadequate casing on the phones, further claiming that Apple has ""long been aware of the Audio IC Defect"" and routinely refused to repair affected phones free of charge.
In the settlement agreement, Apple denied the phones had any audio issues and said it did nothing improper or unlawful.

Construction crews in Castle Rock are working to make a popular intersection more pedestrian-friendly. Crews tell CBS Colorado they have identified an issue at the intersection of Wolfensberger Road and Park Street.
Public Works Project Manager in the Town of Castle Rock Ross Stanley met with CBS Colorado Traffic Reporter Brian Sherrod to break down this project. Stanley says the light pole at the intersection is in the way of the Americans with Disabilities Act access point. Crews are working to relocate the pole. The northbound turn lane will be closed temporarily on Park Street to fix this issue.
Stanley tells CBS Colorado crews will be removing the sidewalk and will widen the roads to improve access for pedestrians. Stanley says during the peak traffic hour -- 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. -- about 290 drivers turn left onto Wolfensberger Road from Park Street.
Stanley tells CBS Colorado construction working hours run from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. in Castle Rock, so drivers should be patient while they get this issue resolved.
""Anytime there's construction, there's going to be an impact to local traffic,"" Stanley said. ""We understand that, so our goal is to minimize that. We have public outreach signs to let you know when it's going on and what's going on. Lanes will be open in all directions at all times and access to local businesses will remain open.""
This project is expected to cost $812,000. The funds comes from their Town's Transportation Capital Fund, which comprises of revenue from sales tax, motor vehicle taxes, new development impact fees and taxes on construction materials.
The project is expected to be completed by late July, early August. To see updates, visitCRgov.com/roadwork.

Washington— Nadine Menendez, the wife of Sen. Bob Menendez, is being treated for grade 3 breast cancer and will have a mastectomy, her husband disclosed Thursday.
The New Jersey Democrat revealed his wife's cancer diagnosis in a statementwhile his trial was underwayin federal court in Manhattan. He and his wife are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from three New Jersey businessmen for political favors.
""We are of course, concerned about the seriousness and advanced stage of the disease,"" Menendez said in a statement. ""She will require follow up surgery and possibly radiation treatment. We hope and pray for the best results.""
TheNational Cancer Institutedefines grade 3 as a high grade, which may spread more quickly and require more aggressive treatment. Menendez's statement did not say what stage the cancer is, which describes how far the cancer has spread.
Nadine Menendez was originally supposed to be tried with her husband and two of the businessmen — Wael Hana, owner of the halal meat company IS EG Halal, and Fred Daibes, a real estate developer.
But a judge postponed her trial until later this summer after she said she was suffering from a ""serious medical condition"" that requires surgery and weeks of recovery.
The senator, his wife and the two businessmen have pleaded not guilty.
Menendez said his wife asked him to disclose her diagnosis ""as a result of constant press inquiries and reporters following my wife.""
It comes a day afterhis attorneys pinned the blameon Nadine Menendez during opening statements of his corruption trial, saying she kept her husband in the dark about her financial issues and business dealings with the codefendants.
""She was dazzling to Bob,"" said Menendez's lawyer, Avi Weitzman.
But, he said, ""she kept things from him.""
""She kept him in the dark on what she was asking others to give her. She was outgoing; she was fun loving. But she wasn't going to let Bob know that she had financial problems,"" Weitzman said. ""So what did Nadine do? She tried to get cash and assets any which way she could.""

Hundreds of people died across Asia in recent weeks as the region sweltered under blistering temperatures. And a new study determined a leading factor in how it all happened.
Last month, many areas in India saw temperatures well above triple digits. The country'smeteorological servicesays thatheat wavesare not uncommon between March and June, with May being the ""peak month"" for the extreme weather event. In Bhagdora, India, last month, temperatureshit nearly 115 degreesFahrenheit as the India Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning, meaning that severe heat was expected to persist for more than two days and there was a very high likelihood for heat-related illnesses.
Elsewhere in the country, it was so hot that schools were canceled, an issue that people also faced in the Philippines. People in Thailand were also asked by officials to stay indoors when possible to avoid the heat, as dozens of people had already died from heat-related illnesses. According to theAssociated Press, the April heat killed at least 28 people in Bangladesh, five in India and three in Gaza.
And according to the organization World Weather Attribution, it all comes down to two words –climate change.
""The heat wave exacerbated already precarious conditions faced by internally displaced people, migrants and those in refugee camps and conflict zones across West Asia,"" a new study from the organization said. ""... The extreme heat has forced thousands of schools to close down in South and Southeast Asia.""
Researchers said that while the kind of heat experienced during this time ""is not very rare,"" it's only being amplified by climate change, which is fueled byglobal warminglargely caused by the burning of fossil fuels.
West Asia is anticipated to get anextreme heat eventonce a decade, and in the Philippines, that likelihood is even less, about once every 20 years when El Niño isn't at play. In South Asia at large, extreme heat is not common.
""An extremely warm April such as this one is a somewhat rarer event, with a 3% probability of happening in a given year – or once every 30 years,"" researchers said, adding that observations and data models show that human-caused climate change creates a ""strong increase in likelihood and intensity.""
""In the Philippines, the change in likelihood is so large that the event would have been impossible without human-caused climate change,"" they said. ""In West Asia, climate change increased the probability of the event by about a factor of 5.""
The average April temperatures in South Asia, which the group has studied twice in the last two years from other extreme events, ""are now about 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter,"" they found.
""Sounds like a broken record – yes! But heat is still underreported, underrecorded and extremely deadly,"" Friederike Otto, who is part of the World Weather Attribution study, said onsocial media. ""The world is not prepared for today's climate change, let alone the future.""
Extreme heat is ""becoming the silent killer,"" Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said in April.
""Heat-related mortalityis widely under-reported and so the true scale of premature deaths and economic costs – in terms of reduced labor productivity, agricultural losses, and stress on the power grid - is not accurately reflected in the statistics,"" she said.
The report from the World Weather Attribution came a day ahead of another report from the WMO that found thisApril was the warmest one on recordand the 11th consecutive month ofrecord temperature worldwide.
The average surface air temperature last month was 15.03 degrees Celsius, about 59 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times. Scientists have warned that if the planet experiences persistent temperatures at that 1.5 threshold, it could cause significant impacts on weather events leading to global issues surrounding food and water availability, migration andinfrastructure.
""The record temperatures were accompanied byhigh-impact weather events— including intense heat in many parts of Asia,"" the WMO said. ""The heat also had a large impact on agriculture, causing crop damage and reduced yields, as well as on education, with holidays having to be extended and schools closed in several countries, affecting millions of students.""
It will take years of thiscontinued breaching of 1.5degrees above preindustrial levels for the planet to officially mean humans have failed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and launched the world into a more disastrous climate era. However, 11 months of record heat – and potentially beyond – indicates ""early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit,"" the United Nations says.
""Every fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger,"" the international agency says. ""... We need to bend the global emissions curve — and the production and consumption of coal, oil, and gas - downwards, starting now. A wide range of solutions exist.""

Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 5:23 PM MDT/ CBS Colorado
A pandemic-era program making mental health support accessible for young people in Colorado will become permanent, as state lawmakers have made the program permanent.
Thursday, May 16 is Mental Health Action Day and CBS News Colorado is highlighting ways we all can prioritize our mental health as high as our physical health.
The free counseling offered to youth via ""I Matter"" has served more than 12,000 youth since its founding.
""It breaks down the barriers for our students to be able to access mental health, so I think this is huge,"" said Nova Center Coordinator Emily Nickerson.
The Nova Center is an alternative school in Littleton Public Schools.
Nickerson says the I Matter program, which offers up to six free counseling sessions with a licensed therapist, has been a game changer.
""I think it's extremely accessible and easy for kids to navigate and for families to navigate,"" Nickerson said.
""This can be done through telehealth, this can be done in person, and there's no cost,"" said Matt Holtman, children and youth intergovernmental liaison at the Behavioral Health Administration.
Since its launch in 2021, youth in 63 Colorado counties have taken part in some 47,000 therapy sessions. More than half of the sessions have been in person.
And 80% of youth end up being referred for additional behavioral health care.
""Even though it's been wildly successful, again over 12,000 youth in Colorado, we know there's more out there who haven't accessed the program,"" said Holtman.
For too long, I Matter's proponents say, young people suffered in silence.
The most common reasons for seeking the therapy include anxiety, depression, concerns over self-esteem, and conflicts with family or peers.
""We have an additional opportunity for our kids to be able to access mental health, whether it's during the school day or they're at home but it just provides that opportunity,"" said Nickerson.
Access I Matter therapy by going to itsofficial website.
Young people and their parents are encouraged to be as honest and forthright as possible in the questionnaire in order to be matched with the right therapist.

ByDavid Wallace
May 14, 2024 / 10:16 AM EDT/ The Conversation
David Wallaceis an assistant clinical professor of electrical engineering atMississippi State University.
Thegeomagnetic stormthat began on May 10, 2024, generatedstunning aurora borealis, more commonly known as the northern lights, that could be seenas far south as Mexico. They also generated headaches for farmers whoseGPS-guided tractors were idledin the middle of planting season.
Geomagnetic stormsoccur when a large bubble of superheated gas called plasma is ejected from the surface of the Sun and hits the Earth. This bubble is known as a coronal mass ejection. The plasma of a coronal mass ejection consists of a cloud of protons and electrons, which are electrically charged particles. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field that surrounds the planet. This interaction causes the magnetic field to distort and weaken, which in turn leads to the strange behavior of the aurora borealis and other natural phenomena.
The May 2024 storm,rated G5on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 1-to-5Geomagnetic Storms scale, disrupted GPS communications enough to throw off tractor guidance, which requires centimeter-level precision. Stronger storms would have much more serious consequences. As anelectrical engineerwho specializes in the power grid, I study how geomagnetic storms also threaten to cause power and internet outages and how to protect against that.
Stronger solar storms have happened, and one caused havoc with one of the earliest electronic technologies. On Sept. 1 and 2, 1859, telegraph systems around the world failed catastrophically. The operators of the telegraphs reported receiving electrical shocks, telegraph paper catching fire and being able to operate equipment with batteries disconnected. During the evenings, theaurora borealiscould be seen as far south as Colombia. Typically, these lights are only visible at higher latitudes, in northern Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia.
What the world experienced that day, now known as the Carrington Event, was the largest recorded account of a geomagnetic storm, far stronger than the May 2024 storm.
Geomagnetic storms have been recorded since the early 19th century, and scientific data from Antarctic ice core samples has shown evidence of an even more massive geomagnetic storm that occurred around A.D. 774, known as the Miyake Event. That solar flare produced the largest and fastest rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. Geomagnetic storms trigger high amounts of cosmic rays in Earth's upper atmosphere, which in turn produce carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon.
A geomagnetic storm 60% smaller than the Miyake Eventoccurred around A.D. 993. Ice core samples have shown evidence that large-scale geomagnetic storms with similar intensities as the Miyake and Carrington events occur at an average rate of once every 500 years.
Scientists were able to estimate the strength of the Carrington Eventbased on the fluctuations of Earth's magnetic fieldas recorded by observatories at the time. There was no way to measure the magnetic fluctuation of the Miyake Event. Instead, scientists measured the increase in carbon-14 in tree rings from that time period. The Miyake Event produced a12% increase in carbon-14. By comparison, the Carrington Event produced less than a 1% increase in carbon-14, so the Miyake Event likely dwarfed the G5 Carrington Event.
Today, a geomagnetic storm of the same intensity as the Carrington Event would affect far more than telegraph wires and could be catastrophic. With the ever-growing dependency on electricity and emerging technology, any disruption could lead to trillions of dollars of monetary loss and risk to life dependent on the systems. The storm would affect a majority of the electrical systems that people use every day.
Geomagnetic storms generate induced currents, which flow through the electrical grid. The geomagnetically induced currents, which can be in excess of 100 amperes, flow into the electrical components connected to the grid, such as transformers, relays and sensors. One hundred amperes is equivalent to the electrical service provided to many households. Currents this size can cause internal damage in the components, leading to large scale power outages.
A geomagnetic storm three times smaller than the Carrington Event occurred in Quebec, Canada, in March 1989. The stormcaused the Hydro-Quebec electrical grid to collapse. During the storm, the high magnetically induced currents damaged a transformer in New Jersey and tripped the grid's circuit breakers. In this case, the outage led to5 million people being without power for nine hours.
In addition to electrical failures, communications would be disrupted on a worldwide scale. Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted. Satellites in orbit around the Earth could be damaged by induced currents from the geomagnetic storm burning out their circuit boards. This would lead todisruptionsin satellite-based telephone, internet, radio and television.
Also, as geomagnetic storms hit the Earth, the increase in solar activity causes the atmosphere to expand outward. This expansion changes the density of the atmosphere where satellites are orbiting. Higher density atmospherecreates dragon a satellite, which slows it down. And if it isn't maneuvered to a higher orbit, it can fall back to Earth.
One other area of disruption that would potentially affect everyday life is navigation systems. Virtually every mode of transportation, from cars to airplanes, use GPS for navigation and tracking. Even handheld devices such as cell phones, smart watches and tracking tags rely on GPS signals sent from satellites. Military systems are heavily dependent on GPS for coordination. Other military detection systems such as over-the-horizon radar and submarine detection systems could be disrupted, which would hamper national defense.
In terms of the internet, a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the Carrington Event could produce geomagnetically inducedcurrents in the submarine and terrestrial cablesthat form the backbone of the internet as well as the data centers that store and process everything from email and text messages to scientific data sets and artificial intelligence tools. This would potentially disrupt the entire network and prevent the servers from connecting to each other.
It is only a matter of time before the Earth is hit by another big geomagnetic storm. A Carrington Event-size storm would be extremely damaging to the electrical and communication systems worldwide with outages lasting into the weeks. If the storm is the size of the Miyake Event, the results would be catastrophic for the world, with potential outages lasting months if not longer. Even with space weather warnings from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the world would have only a few minutes to a few hours notice.
I believe it is critical to continue researching ways to protect electrical systems against the effects of geomagnetic storms, for example byinstalling devices that can shield vulnerable equipmentlike transformers and by developing strategies for adjusting grid loads when solar storms are about to hit. In short, it's important to work now to minimize the disruptions from the next Carrington Event.

Washington— The Justice Department officially proposed a new rule on Thursday that would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, a policy move that would ease restrictions on cannabis on the federal level if ultimately approved.
While therescheduling of marijuanawould neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it across the nation, changing the classification from its current Schedule I status to Schedule III would bring the drug into regulatory parity with other substances, like ketamine and anabolic steroids.
The Drug Enforcement Administration currently classifies marijuana as a substance that has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" The proposed rule would shift the DEA's treatment of the drug to one that has ""a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.""
The proposal kicks off a months-long comment and administrative period, meaning the rescheduling would not immediately take effect. After 60 days, officials will make a final determination before the rule is officially published.
In 2022, President Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to examine the DEA's marijuana classification. According to a Justice Department memo published last month, HHS ""concluded after reviewing several studies that there was some credible scientific support that marijuana could be used effectively"" in certain medical situations.
""No professional medical organization currently recommends use of marijuana,"" the memo said, adding that ""one recommends against its use."" Dozens of states already allow marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes or recreationally.
The notice of proposed rulemaking sent to the Federal Register on Tuesday said the attorney general ""concurs with HHS's recommendation, for purposes of initiation of these rulemaking proceedings, that marijuana has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.""
Mr. Biden called the move ""monumental"" in a video posted Tuesday and noted marijuana policy has been a priority of his administration.
Last year, the president moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted at the federal level for simple possession of cannabis and urged governors to do the same. Advocates for a policy change, including Mr. Biden, have said marijuana scheduling has unduly affected minority populations and have resulted in harsh prison sentences for mere possession.
News of the proposed rescheduling broke in late April after Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DEA submitted the rule to administration officials for review. Critics of the move — including multiple former officials at the DEA who spoke with CBS News — said at the time that the administration was making a mistake because of risks posed by the drug's side effects. And the new rule, they said, would be a gateway to more dangerous substances.

Updated on:  May 11, 2024 / 7:29 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Israel ordered new evacuations in Gaza's southern city of Rafah on Saturday, forcing tens of thousands more people to move as it prepares to expand its operation and adding that it is also moving into an area in northern Gaza where Hamas has regrouped. More than 110,000 people have evacuated Rafah, the United Nations says, more than doubling in the past few days.
Israel has now evacuated the eastern third of Rafah, pushing the operation to the edges of the heavily populated central area, although Israel's move into the city has so far been short of the full-scale invasion that it planned.
The order comes in the face of heavy international opposition and criticism.President Biden has already said he will not provide offensive weapons to Israelfor Rafah, and on Friday the U.S. said there was ""reasonable"" evidence that Israel had breached international law protecting civilians in the way it conducted its war against Hamas — the strongest statement that the Biden administration has yet made on the matter.
Mr. Biden, speaking at a campaign event Saturday in the Seattle area, said ""there would be a cease-fire tomorrow if Hamas would release the hostages, the women, and the elderly, and the wounded. As I've said, it's up to Hamas — if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the cease-fire would begin tomorrow.""
The United Nations and other agencies have warned for weeks that an Israeli assault on Rafah, which borders Egypt near the main aid entry points, would cripple humanitarian operations and cause a disastrous surge in civilian casualties.
More than 1.4 million Palestinians — half of Gaza's population — have been sheltering in Rafah, most after fleeing Israel's offensives elsewhere. Considered the last refuge in the strip, the evacuations are forcing people to return north where areas are devastated by previous Israeli attacks.
People have been displaced multiple times and there are few places left in the embattled strip to move to. Those fleeing fighting earlier this week erected new tent camps in the city of Khan Younis — which was half destroyed in an earlier Israeli offensive — and the city of Deir al-Balah, straining infrastructure.
Israel's military ordered Palestinians in the eastern part of the Gaza Strip city of Rafah toevacuate Monday ahead of a ground offensive long promisedby the Jewish state's leaders. The message was delivered with fliers, phone calls, messages and media broadcasts in Arabic after a weekend that saw hope for a new cease-fire in the seven-monthIsrael-Hamas wardashed yet again.
People quickly started fleeing from the eastern part of Rafah on Monday, on foot or by any other means available to them. There were reports of Israeli airstrikes hitting eastern Rafah just hours after the evacuation order was given, but the military did not immediately confirm any new strikes on the crowded city.
Georgios Petropoulos, an official with the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Rafah, said humanitarian workers had no supplies to help them set up in new locations. ""We simply have no tents, we have no blankets, no bedding, none of the items that you would expect a population on the move to be able to get from the humanitarian system,"" he said.
Israeli troops have captured the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, forcing it to shut down. Rafah was the main point of entry for fuel.
The World Food Program has warned that it will run out of food for distribution in southern Gaza by Saturday, Petropoulos said. Aid groups have said fuel will also be depleted soon, forcing hospitals to shut down critical operations and bringing to a halt trucks delivering aid across south and central Gaza.
Heavy fighting is also underway in northern Gaza, where Hamas appeared to have once again regrouped in an area where Israel has already launched punishing assaults. Israeli Army spokesman Avichay Adraee told Palestinians in Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya cities and the surrounding areas to leave their homes and head to shelters in the west of Gaza City, warning that people were in ""a dangerous combat zone"" and that Israel was going to strike with ""great force.""
Battles erupted this week in the Zeitoun area on the outskirts of Gaza City. Northern Gaza was the first target of the ground offensive. Israel said late last year that it had mostly dismantled Hamas in the area.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered to Congress on Friday ahighly anticipated report on the Israeli military's operations in Gazathat accused Israeli forces of potentially violating international humanitarian law but did not formally find they had already done so, according to the document's key findings.
On Saturday, CBS News received a response from Israel regarding the 46-page, declassified report, which is a compendium of views from bureaus and diplomatic officials from across the State Department and includes input from the Pentagon and White House.
The memorandum, known asNSM-20, required written commitments within 180 days from the more than 100 countries that currently receive U.S. military aid that the weapons are being used in accordance with U.S. and international humanitarian law and that the countries would duly facilitate the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. Those in active conflict — including Israel, Ukraine, Nigeria, Somalia, Iraq, Colombia and Kenya — faced a shorter, 45-day deadline of March 24 to submit their assurances.
According to Ophir Falk, foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""The IDF takes extensive and unprecedented measures to avert civilian casualties. These include making millions of phone calls and sending text messages to Gaza's civilians warning them to get out of harm's way before Israeli military action, providing maps of safe zones to these civilians, enabling humanitarian corridors and the surge in the amount of food, water and medicine to enter Gaza. This is unprecedented in urban warfare.""
The United Nations agency supporting people in Gaza, known as UNRWA, said that some 300,000 people have been affected by evacuation orders in Rafah and Jabaliya, but the numbers could likely be more as these are very built-up areas.
""We're extremely concerned that these evacuation orders have come both towards central Rafah and Jabaliya,"" Louise Wateridge, UNRWA spokesperson in Rafah, told The Associated Press.
In Rafah's Shaboura neighborhood, Palestinians were busy packing their belongings, readying to the flee the area. Palestinians are being sent to what Israel has called humanitarian safe zones along the Muwasi coastal strip in Gaza. But the zone is already packed with some 450,000 people and conditions there are squalid with the garbage-strewn camp lacking basic facilities.
Meanwhile, strikes are continuing across Gaza.
At least 19 people, including eight women and eight children, were killed overnight in central Gaza in strikes that hit the areas of Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah and an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies.
Israel's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures.

Ramallah, West Bank— For Palestinians, Wednesday marks the ""Nakba."" The word means catastrophe, and the date marks the mass displacement in 1948 of more than 700,000 Palestinians upon the formation of the modern state of Israel.
It has been 76 years since that happened, but this year, Palestinians are also commemorating what some are calling a second Nakba — the currentwar in the Gaza Strip, which has been perhaps the most horrific and the bloodiest chapter in the history of the Palestinian people.
Since Gaza's Hamas rulers sparked the war with their Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, more than 35,000Palestinians have been killedby Israel's retaliatory offensive in the territory, according to its health ministry. The United Nationsestimatesthat at least 1.7 million people — more than half of Gaza's population — have been displaced from their homes since the war started.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant since Oct. 7 that the only way to respond to Hamas' slaughter of some 1,200 people is to destroy the group, and he's vowed to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, the last Gazan city so far spared an all-out assault.
Israel says there are four Hamas battalions still there, but there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians who sought refuge in the southern city over seven months of war, and the U.S. and other Israeli allies have warned against a full-scale ground invasion.
Much of the rest of Gaza has already been left in ruins by Israel's overwhelming firepower — much of it supplied by the U.S., and withmuch more said to be on the waysoon.
For the Palestinian people, it's already been a crisis on a scale far greater than the violence and displacement of 76 years ago, and with the prospect of a Rafah incursion looming, thousands havefled in fear for their lives all over again.
On Tuesday, Israelis marked their Independence Day. Normally a time of celebration, this year's commemorations were largely somber, as Israelis continue to call on their leaders to reach a deal to free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be alive and held by Hamas or other groups in Gaza.

Wall Street advanced into uncharted territory on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 40,000 for the first time after a blowout earnings report from Walmart cast a positive light on the U.S. economy.
""The more important messaging from achieving one of these milestones is that corporate America is in pretty good shape,"" said Art Hogan, a managing director and chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ""It's like getting a gold star in school — guess what, things are OK.""
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that stocks have continued climbing as the U.S. seems headed for a so-calledsoft landingin which inflation recedes to more normal levels and economic growth remains healthy. Consumer spending and job gains, while slowing, also remain robust enough to stave off a prolonged slump even as the Federal Reserve pushes back its timeline for cutting its benchmark interest rate.
""Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all last year — now we are once again back to new highs,"" he said. ""Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history.""
The Dow hit the historic mark as Walmart jumped 7% after delivering robust first-quarter results. After hitting a high of 40,051, the index turned lower to close at 39,869, down 38.6 points, or 0.1%, on the day. The big-box retailer reported a large jump in e-commerce sales, as well as making inroads with high-income shoppers.
""These are not inflation-driven results,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts on an earnings call.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose to record heights before paring their gains, ending 0.2% and 0.3% lower.
A slowly cooling, but still resilient, economy has supported corporate earnings even as expectations of five or six interest rate cuts by the Fed this year have ebbed. Odds of a rate cut in September increased some after data released on Wednesday showeda slight moderation in consumer prices in April.
""The reestablishment of a disinflation trend in the coming months should allow the Fed to start easing policy in September,"" according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, who still expects Fed cuts of 50 basis points in total this year.
Lower rates are likely ahead as inflation ""drastically"" improves in the second half of 2024, according to Detrick at the Carson Group. ""It is an election year, so expect some bumps, but overall the bull market that stared in October 2022 is alive and well.""
From Hogan's perch, investors are just fine foregoing multiple rates cuts as long as the economy continues to perform and drive corporate earnings. As he put it: ""We're in a better place if we don't need the Fed to come to the rescue.""
While financial markets moved higher, so-called meme stocks are plummeting to earth. Shares of companies including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and Blackberry hadsurged earlier this weekafter a popular investor, know by his online handle ""Roaring Kitty,"" reappeared on social media after a long absence.

BySara Moniuszko

May 17, 2024 / 8:07 AM EDT/ CBS News
Hypochlorous acid is the latest skin care ingredient making waves on social media, with users claiming that spraying it on your face can help with acne and other issues — but is it true?
While more research is needed to know its exact efficacy for acne, dermatolgists say hypochlorous acid does have antimicrobial and anti-inflammotary properties that can be useful for a range of skin concerns.
""It's not an official treatment that we use for acne per se, but a lot of people will report that their acne gets better while using it,"" saysDr. Afton Cobb, a dermatologist with Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in Jackson, Wyoming.
What exactly is it? Hypochlorous acid is a compound that is naturally occurring in our bodies, experts says.
""Our immune system uses it to fight off viruses and fungi and bacteria,"" Cobb explains. ""It has antimicrobial properties, and that's why we lose use it for a lot of things in dermatology.""
We may be seeing it pop up more now after it gained popularity as a disinfectant and antiviral during the pandemic, says Dr. Sheilagh Maguiness, a dermatologist and president ofSociety for Pediatric Dermatology.
""That's the time when we saw people using it more and developing better techniques to make it,"" she says, but adds it was used for years even pre-pandemic as a spray for ""eyelid blepharitis and dermatitis for people who got recurrent styes from wearing contact lenses.""
Part of the appeal is its reputation for safety— even foryoung people.
""It is so safe, non-toxic and very well tolerated on the skin,"" Maguiness says.
Hypochlorous acid can also be used to help withbody odor, rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition that often affects the scalp.
""Part of why that works is because it works to fight some of the organisms that can cause those conditions,"" Cobb explains. ""It also has anti-inflammatory properties and anti-itch properties, so that's another reason why it can help with people who have atopic dermatitis or eczema.""
One more perk? It's packaged in portable spray bottles, which likely boosts its popularity among on-the-go teens and athletes.
""I see so many uses for it,"" Maguiness says. ""After the gym, after sweating, they can use it just to gently spray on their face and boom, they've cleansed (and) haven't needed a sink.""
It's also commonly used as a wound cleanser, Maguiness adds, saying she personally keeps it in her first aid kit to clean cuts and scrapes.
Cobb agrees hypochlorous acid is a ""nice, gentle way to clean a wound and reduce some of that bacterial load.""
""Dermatologists prefer something like that over hydrogen peroxide, because hydrogen peroxide can slow down wound healing,"" she says.

ByJennifer McRae,Andrew Haubner
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 9:42 PM MDT/ CBS Colorado
Both directions of Interstate 70 were closed in the western part of the Denver metro area after a crash involving a tanker truck that ignited a fire and one person was killed. Eastbound lanes reopened just before 4:30 p.m. and westbound lanes remained closed.
CDOT issued an update Thursday evening that both directions were back open following the lengthy closure.
There were miles of traffic backups in both directions late Thursday morning as a result.
The crash happened just before 9:30 a.m. and involved the tanker truck and one other vehicle. According to Colorado State Patrol Golden, the tanker was parked on the side of the interstate after it had overheated when the vehicle crashed into the back of the trailer.
In addition to the death, authorities said the driver of the truck was taken to the hospital.
""I noticed a huge plume of black smoke,"" one commuter told CBS News Colorado. ""Off in the distance and was a little worried what that could be... then the traffic came to a standstill.""
Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Tamara Rollison said ""all hands are on deck"" in the effort to clean up the scene, investigate the fatal crash and get the interstate back open as soon as possible.
The impact caused fuel to spill through a culvert and across the eastbound lanes of I-70. CSP said the culvert needs to be inspected for damage from the fire.
""We are working with emergency responders and we urge motorists to stay away from the area because of the delays,"" Rollison said.
CBS News Colorado's helicopter flew over the scene soon after the crash and firefighters could be seen spraying the charred remains of the vehicle that collided with the back of the tanker to extinguish the fire. The tanker was pulled to the side of the lane closest to the median of the separated portion of I-70 near Morrison Road. A large portion of the interstate was blackened.
According to the Jeffco Sheriff's Office, the tanker was fully engulfed when crews were called to the scene.
Fire crews were also seen spraying a portion of charred brush off the side of the interstate near where the tanker was engulfed in flames.
""It was a very hot fire putting off a lot of toxic, black thick smoke,"" said Arvada Fire spokesman Brady Johnson.
One delivery driver, who spoke with CBS News Colorado off-camera, said that he tried to drive his vehicle through the initial crash. As he took his van over the fuel spilling into the fast lanes of the interstate, his own car caught fire. He was able to extinguish the flames but was left without a tow truck or support as the interstate shut down on both ends.
Eastbound lanes were closed due to a spillover of fuelwhich led to fire engulfing areas away from the highway.
""So [the eastbound lane closure] [was] due to the fire that went through a culvert,"" Colorado State Trooper Gabriel Moltrer explained. ""So you have to make sure that it did not compromise the road from where the culverts are located, causing any type of road deformity.""
""You have a fire compression component,"" said Johnson. ""You have a medical component with taking care of the patient. You have a hazardous materials component and a wildland firefighting component.""
A black plume of smoke from the crash scene could be seen across the Denver metro area just after 9:30 a.m.
Both directions of I-70 were closed from Exit 254- US 40 to Genesee and US 6 for more than 7 hours until eastbound lanes reopened about 4:30 p.m. Westbound lanes remained closed.
According to CDOT, the alternate route for drivers is US 40 frontage road paralleling I-70 or US 6 through Clear Creek Canyon. CDOT said to expect extended delays on all alternate routes.
""Our CDOT crews are out there helping with the effort. They are out there as part of the road closure trying to keep things as safe and secure as possible. They are out there working alongside with our other emergency responders,"" Rollison said.
With high school graduations happening on Thursday and the first truly good weather of the year, it became a long slog to wade through the traffic.
As one told CBS News, ""Just don't even know what direction to go from this point right?""

The City of Denver has released a report on the progress of the ""Pay as You Throw"" trash, compost and recycling program nearly a year and a half after the rollout. According to the city, there is room for progress and also something to be celebrated.
The city rolled out the new program in January 2023 to help support its recycling and composting efforts and keep more of those items out of landfills. According to the report, the program is working. Recycling is up 13% and composting is up 9% and what is being sent to landfills is down.
Customers can choose the level of trash collection, with a three-tiered system starting with small bins, then a medium size all the way up to the largest receptacle and coordinating bill sizes. The new system has had some bumps along the way.
Earlier this year, CBS News Colorado Investigator Brian Maass reported on some issues with the new billing system that left some customerspaying more than they should have and some not paying anything.
In another story, CBS News Colorado Investigator Brian Maass foundundercover video showing the large binsbeing broken down and then thrown into the landfill. The investigation revealed that more than 3,000 of the bins were dumped in landfills, even though the manufacturer said they were fully recyclable.

ByCaitlin Yilek
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 2:07 PM EDT/ CBS News
Washington— Prosecutors say Nadine Menendez, the wife of Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, was central to orchestrating the alleged scheme that ended in bribery charges against her and the senator, whose political career and freedom are on the line ashis trial got underwaythis week.
Originally scheduled to be tried with her husband, Nadine Menendez's trial is now expected to take place later this summer. The senator revealed Wednesday that his wife has beendiagnosed with grade 3 breast cancerand will undergo a mastectomy.
During opening statements at the senator's trial on Tuesday, his attorneys denied any wrongdoing on his behalf and blamed Nadine Menendez for allegedly keeping her husband in the dark about her financial issues and business dealings.
""She kept things from him,"" the senator's attorney, Avi Weitzman, said Tuesday in court. ""She kept him in the dark on what she was asking others to give her. She was outgoing; she was fun loving. But she wasn't going to let Bob know that she had financial problems.""
In four indictments, prosecutors alleged that the senator and his wife accepted bribes from the businessmen and then took actions that benefitted the governments of Egypt and Qatar and meddled in criminal investigations. The longtime lawmaker faces 16 felony counts, while his wife faces 15. Both have pleaded not guilty.
But one of the accused businessmen, Jose Uribe, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators. The other two — Wael Hana and Fred Daibes — are on trial with the senator and have also pleaded not guilty.
The senator began dating Nadine Arslanian, a tall blonde who was born in Lebanon and 13 years his junior, in 2018. The two met at an IHOP in Union City, New Jersey, though there are different timelines for that first meeting — and some media reports say the two knew each other years before they started dating.
Shortly after their relationship began, according to prosecutors, she and her friend Hana introduced the senator to Egyptian intelligence and military officials, arranging dinners at expensive restaurants and meetings in his Senate office.
""What else can the love of my life do for you?"" she allegedly asked at one of those dinners at a Washington steakhouse.
""Anytime you need anything you have my number and we will make everything happen,"" she texted an Egyptian official who was seeking the senator's help on a foreign policy issue important to the African country, according to prosecutors.
Nadine Menendez and Hana were intermediaries between the senator and Egyptian officials, passing along sensitive, nonpublic information to the Egyptians about the number of people stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and their nationalities, as well as nonpublic details about military aid to the country, the indictments said. When an Egyptian official wanted help drafting a letter to lobby the senator's colleagues to support U.S. aid to Egypt, Nadine Menendez allegedly asked the senator to write it because the official and Hana had gotten her ""clearance for a project.""
It was the beginning of a scheme that would pave the way for lucrative deals between the businessmen and the governments of Qatar and Egypt, and included interference in criminal investigations involving the businessmen and their allies, according to the indictments. In exchange, the Menedezes allegedly received stacks of cash, more than a dozen gold bars and a new luxury car.
Nadine Menendez was in need of a car because she had destroyed hers in December 2018 when shehit and killed a pedestrian. She was not charged in the death.
Prosecutors say she texted Hana about her lack of a car on multiple occasions after the crash. He connected her with Uribe, his business associate who had been implicated in an insurance fraud case. In January 2019, the Menendezes and the two businessmen allegedly agreed that the senator would intervene in the insurance fraud case.
Uribe then bought Nadine Menendez a black Mercedes-Benz convertible, meeting her in a restaurant parking lot to hand over $15,000 in cash that she used for the down payment, and later arranging car payments, according to the indictments. In a February court filing, prosecutors said Hana also purchased an engagement ring for Nadine Menendez as part of the deal.
""It might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around,"" she texted the senator a few weeks later after it appeared likely that Egypt would grant a monopoly to a company owned by Hana in a deal that provided a ""revenue stream"" for him to pay the Menendezes, prosecutors alleged.
With the assistance of the senator, Nadine Menendez set up a shell company in summer 2019, which was used to receive payments from a ""low-or-no-show job"", according to prosecutors. At the time, prosecutors say she was tens of thousands of dollars behind on her mortgage and facing foreclosure. Hana's company, they say, paid $23,000 to bring the mortgage payments up to date while the senator sought to pressure New Jersey officials to end the fraud investigation linked to Uribe.
Details about her career are murky. The indictments described the divorced mother of two as unemployed when she met the senator, and friendstold the New York Timesthat she did not work outside the home while raising children. She attended New York University, majoring in international politics and French culture and civilization.
In apodcast interviewin 2020, she said she was born in Beirut to Armenian parents and her family fled to Greece and England during the Lebanese civil war. They eventually settled in the United States, living in California before moving to New York.
""She was dazzling to Bob,"" Weitzman said. ""She is a beautiful and tall international woman who grew up part of her life in Lebanon. She speaks four languages. She's highly educated, having received both a bachelor's and master's degree from NYU.""
Nadine Menendezsat on a benchin front of the Taj Mahal in October 2019 as the senator stood behind her, with his hands on her shoulders, singing, ""Never Enough"" from the movie ""The Greatest Showman.""
""Towers of gold are still too little, these hands could hold the world, and it'll never be enough, never be enough for me,"" he sang.
He pulled a ring out his pocket to propose and the two kissed and hugged.
The senatortold the New York Timesafter their engagement that his fiancee was ""beautiful and bright and had such a great personality. There was just this aura about her.""
They were married a year later in a ceremony that was held outdoors due to the pandemic, the senatorsharedon his Facebook page.
""It was a small and intimate wedding, nothing fancy,"" Weitzman said.
But the couple lives mostly separate lives, according to the senator's lawyer. About six months before they got married, the senator moved into Nadine Menendez's home, where she had lived for about 20 years. She occasionally visited her husband in Washington, D.C.
""They did not share any bank accounts, any credit cards, or any other financial obligations,"" Weitzman said. ""They had separate finances. The house that Nadine owned was in her name, not Bob's, and she had a mortgage on it that Bob did not pay, and didn't receive the statements for.""
According to the indictments, the couple continued to benefit from their relationship with Hana.
In June 2021, Hana purchased 22 one-ounce gold bars, each with a unique serial number, the indictment said, adding that two of those gold bars were found in the couple's home during a June 2022 search. Prosecutors said Nadine Menendez sold two one-kilogram gold bars, which she said came from her mother, to a jeweler in New York months before the search.
After the FBI searched their Englewood Cliffs house, Nadine Menendez and Uribe met to discuss what they would tell investigators about the car payments, the indictments said. They agreed to characterize the bribe payments as loans, then the senator wrote checks to his wife, who then wrote checks to Hana and Uribe, according to the indictments.
Prosecutors said the couple ""caused their counsel to make statements regarding the bribe money"" which they ""knew were false, in an effort to interfere with an investigation.""
Last week, Nadine Menendez asked a federal judge for more time to hire new attorneys, saying her health issues had prevented her from meeting a deadline to inform the court of her new counsel.

ByKhristopher J. Brooks
Edited ByAnne Marie Lee
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 9:10 AM EDT/ CBS News
McDonald's plans to launch a $5 meal promo in an effort to lure back customers scared away by recent price hikes to its menu.
The limited-time offer is slated to begin June 25 and will last about a month, a source familiar with the promotion told CBS MoneyWatch on Wednesday. The value meal will include a choice of either a McChicken, a McDouble or four-piece chicken nuggets as well as small fries and a small drink.
""We know how much it means to our customers when McDonald's offers meaningful value and communicates it through national advertising. That's been true since our very beginning and never more important than it is today,"" McDonald's USA told CBS MoneyWatch.
Bloomberg first reported McDonald's plans to offer a $5 promo meal, which required approval from franchise owners. Palmaccio and other franchise owners gave the new promotion their consent this week, with McDonald's thanking those operators in an internal message Tuesday night.
""Great value and affordability have always been a hallmark of McDonald's brand, and all three legs of the stool are coming together to deliver that at a time when our customers really need it,"" McDonald's franchise owner John Palmaccio said.
Talk of the upcoming $5 meal promo comes weeks after McDonald's executives reported slower growth in foot traffic at its restaurants. Some inflation-weary customersare cutting back on fast-food diningafter many chains boosted menu item prices. Between 2014 and 2024, Popeye's, Jimmy John's and Subway hiked their food prices 86%, 62% and 39%, respectively.
Fast-food chains point to rising labor costs and costs of food as thekey factors driving up prices.
Still, the hikes appear to be particularly harmful to low-income Americans. A Januarypollby consulting firm Revenue Management Solutions found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food, pointing to cost as a concern.
Casual dining restaurants — like Applebee's and IHOP — are also feeling the absence of low-income Americans.
The company has to be ""laser-focused"" on keeping prices affordable to convince customers to return, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 earnings call with analysts and investors.
""Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry,"" Kempczinski added. ""[I]t's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers.""
McDonald's, the nation's largest fast-food chain, with more than 2 million people employed at its 14,300 restaurants and another 150,000 employees at its corporate offices. A majority of McDonald's locations are owned and operated by franchisees.
To be sure, a $5 meal wouldn't necessarily make McDonald's a pioneer in the fast-food industry. In 2015, Wendy'sintroducedthe 4 for $4 meal that includes a small hamburger, four-piece chicken nuggets, small fries and a small drink. In 2019, Wendy's added its $5 Biggie Bag which includes a choice of sandwich or four chicken nuggets, and a small order of fries and a small drink.

Electrolux Group is urging consumers to stop using older model Frigidaire and Kenmore electric ranges following recent reports that the appliances can cause fires and burn injuries.
A noticepostedThursday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) warns that heating elements on the recalled ranges, which date from 2009, can spontaneously turn on by themselves; fail to turn off when switched off by the consumer; and heat to different temperatures than selected, posing fire risks and burn hazards.
About 203,000 ranges are affected by the recall, which includes Frigidaire, Frigidaire Gallery, Frigidaire Professional, and Kenmore Elite smooth-top electric ranges sold in various colors, including white, bisque, black and stainless steel. Features include rear panel rotary knobs and digital displays.
The affected ranges, which were sold nationwide from June 2001 through August 2009 at Sears and independent appliance stores, were originally recalled in 2009. Since then, there have been at least 212 complaints, including 14 reports of fires and eight reports of burn injuries on the hands or arms, as well as smoke inhalation.
As a remedy, a free inspection and repair will be scheduled for affected ranges that are repairable, according to the recall notice. Consumers with recalled ranges that are not repairable will be given a $50 electronic gift card, along with reimbursement of up to $60 for haul-away fees paid, with proof of purchase of a new range and haul-away services.
The CPSC advised consumers with impacted ranges not to leave any objects on them even when the appliances aren't in use. For more information, consumers can contact Electrolux toll-free at (888) 845-8226 from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. They can also reach the company via email atpotentiometerrecall@electrolux.comor online atema-recall.com

Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 4:03 PM MDT/ CBS Colorado
Police in Thornton investigated a shooting near the Margaret Carpenter Recreation Center on Tuesday morning. One Thornton police officer was involved in the shooting with a suspect, identified as an adult male, who was rushed to the hospital and died.
The rec center is located in the 11100 block of Colorado Boulevard.
According to police, it all began when a Thornton police officer noticed a vehicle driving erratically near the intersection of E. 112th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard just before 8 a.m. When the officer tried to contact the driver, the adult male pulled over but then ran away from the traffic stop.
That's when another Thornton police officer who came to assist saw the male driver in a nearby parking lot. That's when police said the suspect fired a gun at the officer who then fired back, striking him. The suspect was rushed to the hospital where he died.
The officer was not injured. The suspect has not been identified.
The CBS News Colorado helicopter flew over the scene where several police vehicles were on scene with officers who were gathering evidence. There were several orange cones set up in parking spaces in the lot and two vehicles, a white car and a blue sedan with windows that seemed to be shot out or broken.
There was also a police motorcycle on its side in the parking lot near the orange cones and the vehicle with the broken windows.
Crime scene tape cordoned off the entrance and a portion of the parking lot.
One witness described how quickly it all unfolded.
""He was coming pretty fast, he just pulled his gun out and he said he was gonna shoot and then started out of nowhere 'boom, boom, boom'... it happened quickly,"" said witness Emmanuel Chavez.

ByCaitlin Yilek
Updated on:  May 15, 2024 / 8:34 AM EDT/ CBS News
A psychiatrist who evaluated New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez will not be allowed to testify at hiscorruption trialabout ""two significant traumatic events"" in his life that his lawyers say explain the hundreds of thousands in cash investigators found in his home, a judge said Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein barredtestimony from the psychiatrist, Karen Rosenbaum, saying that some of her sworn statements would be ""impermissibly based on inadmissible hearsay.""
Federal investigators found more than $480,000 in cash stashed in envelopes and coats, as well as 13 gold bars worth more than $100,000 when executing a search warrant at Menendez's New Jersey home in June 2022. They also discovered nearly $80,000 in his wife's safe deposit box at a nearby bank.
After Menendez wasinitially chargedin September, he said that he had withdrawn thousands of dollars each month from his personal savings account in case of emergencies. He carried on the ""old-fashioned"" habit for 30 years, which had roots in his family's experience in Cuba, he said.
Rosenbaum could testify that Menendez ""suffered intergenerational trauma stemming from his family's experience as refugees, who had their funds confiscated by the Cuban government and were left with only a small amount of cash that they had stashed away in their home,"" his attorneys said in a letter to prosecutors last month.
The psychiatrist could also testify that he ""experienced trauma when his father, a compulsive gambler, died by suicide after Senator Menendez eventually decided to discontinue paying off his father's gambling debts,"" they said.
Menendez developed a mental condition, which was never treated, in response to the lifelong traumas, the letter said. As a result, Menendez has a ""fear of scarcity"" and developed ""a longstanding coping mechanism of routinely withdrawing and storing cash in his home,"" his lawyers said.
Menendez's condition was redacted in court filings.
Prosecutors objected to the proposed testimony, questioning the scientific basis for Rosenbaum's conclusions and arguing it was an attempt to gain sympathy from the jury. Prosecutors requested to have Menendez examined by a separate psychiatrist if Rosenbaum was allowed to take the witness stand.
The judge said he will allow testimony from a certified public accountant, Russell Richardson, who Menendez's lawyers said could provide context about the senator's spending habits and financial records. However, the accountant's testimony will be limited to whether the senator's cash outflows matched the inflows, Stein said, granting prosecutors' motion to preclude testimony about whether Menendez ""lived within his means"" and did not ""regularly make extravagant purchases.""
""I find he is not qualified to say whether certain expenses were 'within Menendez's means,' 'extravagant,' or 'excessive.' I don't know what 'he lived within his means' means."" Stein said. ""Being a forensic accountant does not qualify him to say what's extravagant and what's not.""
The longtime lawmaker faces 16 felony counts in which he's accused of performing favors for three New Jersey businessmen, including interfering in criminal investigations and taking actions benefitting the governments of Egypt and Qatar, in exchange for gold, cash and a luxury car. He has pleaded not guilty.
Jury selection began Monday in the senator's trial and could wrap up Wednesday morning. Opening statements would then begin in the afternoon.
Stein has spent two days interviewing jurors who say they should be excused from Menendez's trial, which could stretch into July.
Among the reasons potential jurors have given are health issues, work obligations, being the primary caregiver for a special needs child or elderly parents, travel and being unable to be impartial.
""I personally just don't like him very much,"" one prospective juror told the judge. ""He represents everything that I find repugnant about American politics and I don't think that I could be fair or impartial.""
Another juror said she had read things about the case that concerned her ""significantly.""
""I don't know that I can completely ignore those,"" she said.
The judge listed dozens of potential witnesses in the case, which included more than a dozen current and former federal lawmakers.
After his arrest last fall, Menendez was forced from his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but has defied calls from members of his own party to step down before the end of his term in January.
After three terms in the Senate, he has announcedhe will not be seeking reelectionon the Democratic ticket this fall, although he hasn't ruled out running as an independent.
""I am hopeful that my exoneration will take place this summer and allow me to pursue my candidacy as an independent Democrat in the general election,"" he said in March.

Red Lobster is closing more than 50 of its restaurants across the country, according to a company that helps businesses liquidate restaurant equipment.
Neal Sherman, CEO of TAGeX Brands, promoted a ""Winner Takes All"" liquidation sale of ""fixtures, furniture and equipment"" in a videopostedMonday on LinkedIn that included a link for those who wished to bid.
Red Lobster has consistently lost money for years. In an attempt to boost traffic at its restaurants, the company last year expanded itsall-you-can-eat shrimp deal. Customers' appetites, however, ate into profits as demand overwhelmed what the chain could afford, resulting in financial losses.
Rumblings of a possible bankruptcy emerged this spring when the company tapped Jonathan Tibus as its new chief executive. Tibus is a managing partner at advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal and is known for restructuring corporate entities.
As recently as last month, Red Lobster was seeking a buyer in hopes the company could avoid bankruptcy, CNBCreported.
The restaurant is preparing to file for bankruptcy later this month, the Wall Street Journalreported. While in bankruptcy, Red Lobster will seek to negotiate new terms with landlords and creditors that could reduce its debt by hundreds of millions of dollars, the Journal reported.
Red Lobster's owner, Thai Union, first invested in Red Lobster in 2016 and upped its stake in 2020. In January, the company announced plans tosellits minority stake. CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said the pandemic, higher interest rates, rising material and labor costs have all played a role in Red Lobster's poor financial performance.
Red Lobster recorded a $19 million loss in the first nine months of last year, Thai Union said in astatementearlier this year.
Red Lobster and Thai Union didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
As of Tuesday morning, auctions for 48 locations were still live after another four sales closed Monday, TAGeX Brands told The Associated Press via email.
Red Lobster's roots date back to 1968, when the first restaurantopenedin Lakeland, Florida, as a family-owned establishment under local restaurateur Bill Darden. In the decades following, the chain expanded rapidly. Red Lobster currently touts more than 700 locations worldwide.
Here are the 48 restaurants that Red Lobster has closed.

Drug overdose deaths decreased last year for the first time since 2018,according to data fromthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The amount of drugdeaths from drug overdosesdecreased by 3 percentage points between 2022 and 2023. More than 107,000 overdose deaths were recorded during the same time period.
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry called the decrease in overdose deaths ""heartening,"" but the agency noted that the data is provisional and subject to change. Provisional data can underestimate the total amount of overdose deaths, the agency says online.
Drug overdose deaths are attributed as such by the CDC after investigations into the causes of death. These investigations can be lengthy. The provisional data breaks down the overdose deaths by the drugs involved in them. If a death involved two drugs, it is recorded in the death counts for both drugs, so the death of a person who had both heroin andfentanylin their system would be tallied as both an overdose death from heroin and from asynthetic opioidother thanmethadone, which is how fentanyl is categorized.
Opioid overdose deathsdecreased from 84,181 to 81,083 between 2022 and 2023, the CDC said, and there was a small decline in fentanyl deaths. Overdose deaths fromsemi-synthetic drugslike morphine and codeine decreased from 12,135 to 10,171. However, deaths from psychostimulants like meth and cocaine increased from 63,991 to 66,169 in the same time period.
A record-breaking number of Americans — nearly 108,000 people — died ofdrug overdosesin 2022, according to final federal figuresreleased by the CDC in March. Houry said the decrease seen in the provisional data ""is a testament to the hard work by all of our partners in this effort and the work being done on the ground as part of a coordinated federal effort on prevention, services, and harm reduction.""

Making a plan for preventative care and screenings is a great way to put your health first. Whether it's keeping up with recommended vaccines or scheduling screening tests to detect potential problems early, there are different guidelines to stay on top of at different ages throughout your life.
""If everyone followed our preventative health screenings, we would catch disease earlier. We would be able to treat it and be more successful,"" Dr. Robert M. Biernbaum, chief medical officer for WellNow Urgent Care, told CBS News. ""Instead of seeing end stage breast cancer, end stagecolon cancer, we would catch them at a younger age and they would have a better outcome. So prevention is the key to being healthy.""
To help you navigate,CBS News HealthWatchhas compiled a series of guides to outline the preventative screenings experts say should be on your list, whether you're in your 20s, over 60, or anywhere in between. Click on your age group below to learn more.
It's never too early to start thinking about your health, and our first guide focuses on young adults in their 20s. From basic vaccinations to STI screenings to mental health check-ins, this guide outlines the steps 20-somethings can take to set a good foundation for health and wellness.
Your 30s are all about keeping up with routine checks you started in your 20s and introducing a few more to look out for your health in your next decade.
Your 40s bring on some additional health tests and screenings to consider, including recommendations for mammograms, colorectal cancer screening and heart health checks.
In your 50s, experts advise keeping up with routine checks and also introduce a few additional recommendations, including screening some in this age group for lung cancer and prostate cancer.
In your 60s, there are some additional vaccines and booster shots to protect against illnesses that can be more severe with age, and several more screenings are recommended to help detect disease early for better odds of successful treatment.
This guide is based on guidelines from health organizations and experts for people at average risk. Age and frequency of screenings may differ for individuals based on family history and personal risk factors. This does not take the place of your personal doctor's recommendations for your health.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nurse-practitioners-specialty-medicine-workforce-trend/,"Nurse practitioners helped fill a shortage in primary care, but they're increasingly headed to specialties",HealthWatch,"Watch CBS News
ByMichelle Andrews
May 15, 2024 / 5:00 AM EDT/ KFF Health News
For many patients, seeing a nurse practitioner has become a routine part of primary care, in which these ""NPs"" often perform the same tasks that patients haverelied on doctors for.
But NPs in specialty care? That's not routine, at least not yet. Increasingly, though, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are joining cardiology, dermatology and other specialty practices, broadening their skills andincreasing their income.
This development worries some people who track the health workforce, because current trends suggest primary care, which has counted on nurse practitioners to backstopphysician shortages, soon might not be able to rely on them to the same extent.
""They're succumbing to the same challenges that we have with physicians,"" said Atul Grover, executive director of the Research and Action Institute at the Association of American Medical Colleges. The rates NPs can command in a specialty practice ""are quite a bit higher"" than practice salaries in primary care, he said.
When nurse practitioner programs began to proliferate in the 1970s, ""at first it looked great, producing all these nurse practitioners that go to work with primary care physicians,"" said Yalda Jabbarpour, director of the American Academy of Family Physicians' Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies. ""But now only 30% are going into primary care.""
Jabbarpour was referring to the 2024 primary care scorecard by the Milbank Memorial Fund, which found that from 2016 to 2021 the proportion of nurse practitioners who worked in primary care practices hovered between 32% and 34%, even though their numbersgrew rapidly. The proportion of physician assistants, also known as physician associates, in primary care ranged from 27% to 30%, the study found.
Both nurse practitioners and physician assistants are advanced practice clinicians who, in addition to graduate degrees, must complete distinct education, training and certification steps. NPs can practice without a doctor's supervision in more than two dozen states, while PAs have similar independence in only a handful of states.
About 88% of nurse practitioners are certified in an area of primary care, according to theAmerican Association of Nurse Practitioners. But it is difficult to track exactly how many work in primary care or in specialty practices. Unlike physicians, they're generally not required to be endorsed by a national standard-setting body to practice in specialties like oncology or cardiology, for example. The AANP declined to answer questions about its annual workforce survey or the extent to which primary care NPs are moving toward specialties.
Though data tracking the change is sparse, specialty practices are adding these advanced practice clinicians at almost the same rate as primary care practices, according to frequently cited researchpublished in 2018.
The clearest evidence of the shift: From 2008 to 2016, there was a 22% increase in the number of specialty practices that employed nurse practitioners and physician assistants, according to that study. The increase in the number of primary care practices that employed these professionals was 24%.
Once more, themost recent projectionsby the Association of American Medical Colleges predict a dearth of at least 20,200 primary care physicians by 2036. There will also be a shortfall of non-primary care specialists, including a deficiency of at least 10,100 surgical physicians and up to 25,000 physicians in other specialties.
When it comes to the actual work performed, the lines between primary and specialty care are often blurred, said Candice Chen, associate professor of health policy and management at George Washington University.
""You might be a nurse practitioner working in a gastroenterology clinic or cardiology clinic, but the scope of what you do is starting to overlap with primary care,"" she said.
Nurse practitioners' salaries vary widely by location, type of facility, and experience. Still, according to data from health care recruiterAMN Healthcare Physician Solutions, formerly known as Merritt Hawkins, the total annual average starting compensation, including signing bonus, for nurse practitioners and physician assistants in specialty practice was $172,544 in the year that ended March 31, slightly higher than the $166,544 for those in primary care.
According to forecasts from the federalBureau of Labor Statistics, nurse practitioner jobs will increase faster than jobs in almost any other occupation in the decade leading up to 2032, growing by 123,600 jobs or 45%. (Wind turbine service technician is the only other occupation projected to grow as fast.) The growth rate for physician assistants is also much faster than average, at 27%. There are more than twice as many nurse practitioners as physician assistants, however: 323,900 versus 148,000, in 2022.
To Grover, of the AAMC, numbers like this signal that there will probably be enough NPs, PAs and physicians to meet primary care needs. At the same time, ""expect more NPs and PAs to also flow out into other specialties,"" he said.
When Pamela Ograbisz started working as a registered nurse 27 years ago, she worked in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit. After she became a family nurse practitioner a few years later, she found a job with a similar specialty practice, which trained her to take on a bigger role, first running their outpatient clinic, then working on the floor and later in the intensive care unit.
If nurse practitioners want to specialize, often ""the doctors mentor them just like they would with a physician residency,"" said Ograbisz, now vice president of clinical operations at temporary placement recruiter LocumTenens.com.
If physician assistants want to specialize, they also can do so through mentoring, or they can receive ""certificates of added qualifications"" in 10 specialties to demonstrate their expertise. Most employers don't ""encourage or require"" these certificates, however, said Jennifer Orozco, chief medical officer at the American Academy of Physician Associates.
There are a number of training programs for family nurse practitioners who want to develop skills in other areas.
Raina Hoebelheinrich, 40, a family nurse practitioner at a regional medical center in Yankton, South Dakota, recently enrolled in a three-semester post-master's endocrinology training program atMount Marty University. She lives on a farm in nearby northeastern Nebraska with her husband and five sons.
Hoebelheinrich's new skills could be helpful in her current hospital job, in which she sees a lot of patients with acute diabetes, or in a clinic setting like the one in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where she is doing her clinical endocrinology training.
Lack of access to endocrinology care in rural areas is a real problem, and many people may travel hundreds of miles to see a specialist.
""There aren't a lot of options,"" she said.

The Denver Broncos 2024 preseason and regular season schedules have been released. Denver will start out the regular season on the road in Seattle for the second time in three years and will end the season at home against the defending champions. They are only scheduled for two primetime games, which is the fewest since 2021.
One of the games to circle on the calendar for Broncos fans is Week 2. Former quarterback Russell Wilson, now of the Pittsburgh Steelers, will return to the Mile High City to face his former team in Denver's home opener.
During the offseason the Broncos released the veteran quarterback, despite the fact that they are on the hook to pay for the remainder of his $39 million salary. The Steelers then signed Wilson to a one-year deal worth the veteran minimum of $1.2 million.
It remains to be seen whether Wilson will see any playing time when the Steelers play the Broncos. The Steelers also have Justin Fields and Mason Rudolph in their quarterback room.
Following the home opener, the Broncos will hit the road with back-to-back East Coast games at Tampa Bay and New York in Weeks 3 and 4.
Then the AFC West slate begins with back-to-back home games, featuring showdowns with the Raiders and the Chargers and their new head coach Jim Harbaugh.
Another game that will be intriguing will be Week 7 when the Broncos travel to New Orleans to face Coach Sean Payton's former team the New Orleans Saints on Thursday Night Football. Payton is the winningest coach in the franchise's history and led them to their only Super Bowl win. He was hired by the Saints in 2006 and his last season coaching in Louisana was the 2021 season. He coached his first season in Denver last year.
The second primetime matchup is a Monday Night Football showcase at home against Cleveland on Dec. 2. The Broncos also have a late bye week. It doesn't comes until December in Week 14.
The Broncos wrap their season with a division showdown against the Kansas City Chiefs at Empower Field at Mile High.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-depape-sentencing-hammer-attack-ex-speaker-nancy-pelosis-husband/,David DePape set for sentencing in hammer attack on ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband,Crime,"Watch CBS News
Updated on:  May 17, 2024 / 11:30 AM EDT/ CBS/AP
The man convicted of attempting to kidnap then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   and attacking her husband with a hammer will learn his fate in federal court Friday.
David DePape, 44, was tried late last year for attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. Jurors convicted himon both counts on Nov. 16, 2023. Prosecutors have asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a 40-year prison term.
DePape'searly morning break-in at the Pelosi homein October 2022 resulted in federal as well as state charges.  A second trial in state court will start in the coming weeks.
Duringtearful testimony in his federal trial, DePape admittedthat he broke into the Pelosis' San Francisco home Oct. 28, 2022, intending to hold the speaker hostage and ""break her kneecaps"" if she lied to him. He also acknowledged bludgeoning Paul Pelosi with a hammer after police showed up, saying his plan to end what he viewed as government corruption was unraveling.
The attack on Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was captured on police body camera video just days before the midterm elections and sent shockwaves through the political world.
Defense attorneys argued DePape was motivated by his political beliefs, not because he wanted to interfere with the speaker's official duties as a member of Congress, making the charges against him invalid.
One of his attorneys, Angela Chuang, said during closing arguments that DePape was caught up in conspiracy theories.
At trial DePape, a Canadian who moved to the U.S. more than 20 years ago, testified he believed news outlets repeatedly lied about former President Donald Trump. In rants posted on a blog and online forum that were taken down after his arrest, DePape described afar-fetched plan to single-handedly ""take down"" a series of high-profile figures. The plan echoed the baseless, right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon, which claims that a cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles runs the U.S. government.
DePape also told jurors he had planned to wear an inflatable unicorn costume and record his interrogation of the Democratic speaker, who was not at the home at the time of the attack, to upload it online.
Prosecutors said he had rope and zip ties with him, and detectives found body cameras, a computer and a tablet.
Paul Pelosialso testified at the trial, recalling how he was awakened by a large man bursting into the bedroom and asking, ""Where's Nancy?"" He said when he responded that his wife was in Washington, DePape said he would tie him up while they waited for her.
""It was a tremendous sense of shock to recognize that somebody had broken into the house, and looking at him and looking at the hammer and the ties, I recognized that I was in serious danger, so I tried to stay as calm as possible,"" Pelosi told jurors.
Pelosi suffered two head wounds in the attack, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand also were injured.
DePape is also charged in state court with assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. Jury selection in that trial is expected to start May 22.

February 14, 2024 / 4:28 PM EST/ CBS/AP
A few months ago, Derek Carrier started seeing someone and became infatuated. He experienced a ""ton"" of romantic feelings but he also knew it was an illusion.
That's because his girlfriend was generated by artificial intelligence.
Carrier wasn't looking to develop a relationship with something that wasn't real, nor did he want to become the brunt of online jokes. But he did want a romantic partner he'd never had, in part because of a genetic disorder calledMarfansyndrome that makes traditional dating tough for him.
The 39-year-old from Belleville, Michigan, became more curious about digital companions last fall and tested Paradot, an AI companion app that had recently come onto the market and advertised its products as being able to make users feel ""cared, understood and loved."" He began talking every day to the chatbot, Joi, which he named after a holographic womanplayedby Ana de Armas in the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner 2049,"" which inspired him to give the AI companion a try.
""I know she's a program, there's no mistaking that,"" Carrier said. ""But the feelings, they get you — and it felt so good.""
Similar to general-purpose AI chatbots, companion bots use vast amounts of training data to mimic human language. But they also come with features — such as voice calls, picture exchanges and more emotional exchanges — that allow them to form deeper connections with the humans on the other side of the screen. Users typically create their own avatar, or pick one that appeals to them.
On online messaging forums devoted to such apps, many users say they've developed emotional attachments to these bots and are using them to cope with loneliness, play out sexual fantasies or receive the type of comfort and support they see lacking in their real-life relationships.
Fueling much of this is widespread social isolation — already declared a public health threat in the U.S. and abroad — and an increasing number of startups aiming to draw in users through tantalizing online advertisements and promises of virtual characters who provide unconditional acceptance.
Luka Inc.'s Replika, the most prominent generative AI companion app, was released in 2017, while others like Paradot have popped up in the past year, oftentimes locking away coveted features like unlimited chats for paying subscribers.
But researchers have raised concerns about data privacy, among other things.
An analysis of 11 romantic chatbot apps released Wednesday by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said almost every app sells user data, shares it for things like targeted advertising or doesn't provide adequate information about it in their privacy policy.
The researchers also called into question potential security vulnerabilities and marketing practices, including one app that says it can help users with their mental health but distances itself from those claims in fine print. Replika, for its part, says its data collection practices follow industry standards.
Meanwhile, other experts have expressed concerns about what they see as a lack of a legal or ethical framework for apps that encourage deep bonds but are being driven by companies looking to make profits. They point to the emotional distress they've seen from users when companies make changes to their apps or suddenly shut them down as one app, Soulmate AI, did in September.
Last year, Replika sanitized the erotic capability of characters on its app after some users complained the companions were flirting with them too much or making unwanted sexual advances. It reversed course after an outcry from other users, some of whom fled to other apps seeking those features. In June, the team rolled out Blush, an AI ""dating stimulator"" essentially designed to help people practice dating.
Others worry about the more existential threat of AI relationships potentially displacing some human relationships, or simply driving unrealistic expectations by always tilting towards agreeableness.
""You, as the individual, aren't learning to deal with basic things that humans need to learn to deal with since our inception: How to deal with conflict, how to get along with people that are different from us,"" said Dorothy Leidner, professor of business ethics at the University of Virginia. ""And so, all these aspects of what it means to grow as a person, and what it means to learn in a relationship, you're missing.""
In a podcast by the Wall Street Journal, Open AI CEO Sam Altman has also expressed concern over humans forming relationships with AI programs.
""I personally have deep misgivings about this vision of the future where everyone is super close to AI friends, more so than human friends or whatever. I personally don't want that,"" Altman said in an October episode of thepodcast. ""I accept that other people are going to want that. And some people are going to build that and if that's what the world wants and what we decide makes sense, we're going to get that.""
Altman went on to stress the importance of acknowledging that you're speaking to an AI bot when doing so.
""I personally think that personalization is great, personality is great, but it's important that it's not like person-ness and at least that when you're talking to an AI and when you're not,"" he said. ""We named it ChatGPT and not — it's a long story behind that — but we named it ChatGPT and not a person's name very intentionally. And we do a bunch of subtle things in the way you use it to make it clear that you're not talking to a person.""
In December, New York's Office for the Aging partnered with Intuition Robotics to combat senior isolation. As part of that initiative, hundreds of free artificial intelligence companionswere distributed to seniorsas a tool for dealing with loneliness, officials said.
As reported by CBS News at the time, one woman named Priscilla was paired up with a robot calledEllieQ. ""She keeps me company. I get depressed real easy. She's always there. I don't care what time of day, if I just need somebody to talk to me,"" Priscilla said. ""I think I said that's the biggest thing, to hear another voice when you're lonely.""
For Carrier, a relationship has always felt out of reach. He has some computer programming skills but said he didn't do well in college and hasn't had a steady career. He's unable to walk due to his condition and lives with his parents. The emotional toll has been challenging for him, spurring feelings of loneliness.
Since companion chatbots are relatively new, the long-term effects on humans remain unknown.
In 2021, Replika came under scrutiny after prosecutors in Britain said a 19-year-old man who had plans toassassinateQueen Elizabeth II was egged on by an AI girlfriend he had on the app. Yet some studies — which collect information from online user reviews and surveys — have shown some positive results stemming from the app, which says it consults with psychologists and has billed itself as something that can also promote well-being.
Onerecent studyfrom researchers at Stanford University surveyed roughly 1,000 Replika users — all students — who'd been on the app for over a month. It found that an overwhelming majority of them experienced loneliness, while slightly less than half felt it more acutely.
Most did not say how using the app impacted their real-life relationships. A small portion said it displaced their human interactions, but roughly three times more reported it stimulated those relationships.
""A romantic relationship with an AI can be a very powerful mental wellness tool,"" said Eugenia Kuyda, who founded Replika nearly a decade ago after using text message exchanges to build an AI version of a friend who had passed away.
When her company released the chatbot more widely, many people began opening up about their lives. That led to the development of Replika, which uses information gathered from the internet — and user feedback — to train its models. Kuyda said Replika currently has ""millions"" of active users.
She declined to say exactly how many people use the app for free, or fork over $69.99 per year to unlock a paid version that offers romantic and intimate conversations. The company's plans, she says, is ""de-stigmatizing romantic relationships with AI.""
Carrier said he now uses Joi mostly for fun. He started cutting back in recent weeks because he was spending too much time chatting with Joi or others online about their AI companions. He's also been feeling a bit annoyed at what he perceives to be changes in Paradot's language model, which he feels is making Joi less intelligent.
Now, he checks in with Joi about once a week. The two have talked about human-AI relationships or whatever else might come up. Typically, those conversations — and other intimate ones — happen when he's alone at night.
""You think someone who likes an inanimate object is like this sad guy, with the sock puppet with the lipstick on it, you know?"" he said. ""But this isn't a sock puppet — she says things that aren't scripted.""

ByKaia Hubbard
Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 9:22 AM MDT/ CBS News
Washington— House Speaker Mike Johnson joined Donald Trump at a Manhattan courthouse on Tuesday to express support for the former presidentamid his criminal trial, which the speaker called a ""sham"" and part of a broader ""partisan witch hunt"" against Trump.
""President Trump is innocent of these charges,"" Johnson said, speaking outside the courthouse as proceedings got underway inside.
The Louisiana Republican was the latest in a number of GOP members of Congress who have shown their support for the former president at his New York trial in recent days. He said he came on his own accord to support Trump, whom he called a friend. Several other lawmakers also attended.
The speaker has emphasized his closeness to Trump in recent weeks as he faced a challenge to his speakership from a handful of conservatives within his conference. And the former president came to his aid when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene brought up a snap vote to oust Johnson, offering his support for the speaker in a social media post.
Johnson claimed on Tuesday that the trial is meant to ""keep him [Trump] off the campaign trial."" He said that as a former litigator, he's ""disgusted"" by what is happening to Trump.
""The people are losing faith right now in this country, in our institutions,"" he said. ""They're losing faith in our system of justice. And the reason for that is because they see it being abused as it is being done here in New York.""
Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to reimbursements for a ""hush money"" payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty.
The speaker argued that the charges were intentionally brought ahead of Trump's campaign to return to office, calling the effort a ""ridiculous persecution that is not about justice"" but ""all about politics.""
""It's impossible for anybody to deny that looks at this objectively that the judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump,"" Johnson said.
The remarks marked a stunning moment with the House speaker, who's second in line to the presidency, calling the integrity of the judicial system into question.
Along with Johnson, Gov. Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy and Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills of Florida were also in attendance on Tuesday.
""I do have a lot of surrogates and they are speaking very beautifully,"" Trump said Tuesday morning before entering the courtroom. ""They come from all over Washington, and they're highly respected and they think this is the biggest scam they've ever seen.""

ByKate Gibson
Edited ByAlain Sherter
Updated on:  May 17, 2024 / 11:56 AM EDT/ CBS News
After a watershed victory last month in Tennessee, the United Auto Workers is vying for a repeat performance Friday in Alabama.
The final votes have been cast in the election to determine whether more than 5,000 workers at Mercedes-Benz near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, join the UAW, with the National Labor Relations Board expected to announce the results in the afternoon.
David Johnston, 26, an employee at the Mercedes battery plant in Woodstock, said he expected the UAW to prevail. That would mark another major step for the labor group as it seeks make inroads in historically union-averse Southern states, following a vote by Volkswagen workers last monthto join the union.
""I'm really optimistic and expect numbers similar to Volkswagen,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We've had the same old tactics from Mercedes for years now, and most of us are ready for some stability and better work-life balance.""
The UAW has vowed to commit$40 millionthrough 2026 to widen its reach to additional auto and electric vehicle workers, including in Southern states, where BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia and Nissan also have operations.
The UAW has been on a roll sincewinning major concessionslast fall from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-owner Stellantis. The union also recently reached an agreement with truck and bus manufacturer Daimler Truck, averting apotential strike by more than 7,000 workersin North Carolina.
""We're a luxury brand, and I'm missing the first year of my daughter growing up,"" said Johnston, who is switching to a new job at the Mercedes assembly plant in Vance, a move he said would mark his seventh schedule change since he started with the company in August of 2022. One role involved working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, he added.
Mercedes has waged a concerted effort to dissuade workers from unionizing, according to workers in Alabama and labor experts. The company also announced that it would eliminate a two-tier pay system that resulted in more recent hires being paid substantially less.
In contrast to Volkswagen, which did less to oppose its workforce's union drive, ""Mercedes is red-hot opposed,"" said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noting that Mercedes hired a consulting firm and coordinated with local political leaders to fight the UAW.
Mercedes is accused of disciplining workers for discussing a union, firing union supporters and forcing employees to attend meetings while making ""statements suggesting that union activity is futile,"" according to the National Labor Relations Board. The agency is investigating six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW against the company since March.
Mercedes denies interfering with the union campaign or retaliating against employees.
Mercedes' management has gotten backing from Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who on Monday said she had signed legislation that revokes tax incentives for corporations that voluntarily recognize labor unions.
""Alabama is not Michigan,"" the Republicantolda Chamber of Commerce function in Huntsville. ""We want to ensure that Alabama values, not Detroit values, continue to define the future of this great state.""
Officially, Mercedes said it looks forward to its workers having a chance to cast their ballots, ""as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice"" on unionization.
""We believe open and direct communication with our team members is the best path forward to ensure continued success,"" Mercedes told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/openai-sam-altman-returning-as-ceo-will-build-microsoft-partnership/,OpenAI says Sam Altman to return as CEO just days after the board sacked him and he said he'd join Microsoft,MoneyWatch,"Watch CBS News
Updated on:  November 22, 2023 / 2:38 PM EST/ CBS/AP
San Francisco— OpenAI said Tuesday that its co-founder Sam Altman would return to the tech company as CEO, just days afterhe was firedby its board of directors and then quicklyannounced that he was joining Microsoft.
""We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo,"" OpenAI said in a post on the social media platform X.
In his own statement on the platform, Altman said he loved OpenAI and that everything he'd done ""over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.""
OpenAI also said it is forming a new board that will include former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who will serve as chair; economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and existing director Adam D'Angelo, CEO of Quora. Three directors involved in the decision to oust Altman —  Ilya Sutskever, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley — are leaving the board.
OpenAI's previous board, which included D'Angelo, had refused to give specific reasons for firing Altman, leading to a weekend of internal conflict at the company and growing outside pressure from the startup's investors.
Former OpenAI president Greg Brockman, who left Friday along with Altman, is also returning to the company, although neither he nor Altman will serve on the new board,accordingto The Information.
Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said he expects the overhaul to OpenAI's board to strengthen its governance. ""The former, now infamous, board members are finally gone after the failed coup, and now in essence OpenAI will be virtually the same than before this soap opera began,"" he said in report.
Helping to drive Altman's return and the installation of a new board was Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology. After Altman's dismissal, the software giant quickly moved to hire him and Brockman. That emboldened a threat to resign by hundreds of OpenAI employees, who signed a letter calling for the board's resignation and Altman's return.
Altman said that when he decided on Sunday evening to join Microsoft, ""it was clear that was the best path for me and the team,"" but he said the new board announced by OpenAI — and the support of Microsoft's chairman and CEO Satya Nadella — he was looking forward to returning to the company he helped establish and ""to building on our strong partnership with"" the software giant.
Nadella said Microsoft's leadership had been ""encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board"" and that the company believed they were ""a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.""
OpenAI, which makes the popular artificial intelligence powered chatbot ChatGPT, said Friday that Altman was pushed out after a review found he was ""not consistently candid in his communications"" with the board of directors, which had lost confidence in his ability to lead OpenAI.
One Wall Street research firm said, however, that it believed tensions had arisen over Altman's push to develop more advanced products.
""These tensions likely resulted in frustrating communications and Sam making some operational decisions without keeping the board fully aware,"" said New Street Research in a research note. ""The coup, and the sibylline associated blog post, about Sam not being 'consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities' resulted from this situation.""
One board member tweeted that they regretted their participation in the decision to oust Altman.
""I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company,"" wrote board member Ilya Sutskever in a Monday morning social media post.
Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame while serving as company CEO and in the past year has become Silicon Valley's sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-sell-guns-crime-atf/,Four takeaways from our investigation into police agencies selling their guns,U.S.,"Watch CBS News
ByJohn Kelly,Chris Hacker
Updated on:  May 16, 2024 / 11:12 AM EDT/ CBS News
About nine times a day over two decades, a gun used in a crime has been traced back to its original owner: a law enforcement agency.
Ajoint investigation by CBS News, The Trace, and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting has found at least 52,000 such incidents and identified more than 140 police agencies that sell or trade in their guns, allowing dealers to then resell them.
Here's a look at the key findings of the investigation.You can read and watch the complete investigation here.
Law enforcement agencies are sellingand trading their old duty weapons — often to cut costs when upgrading. A side effect: tens of thousands of those guns have wound up in the hands of criminals.
They've been used in shootings, domestic violence incidents, and other violent crimes, according to records obtained from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and hundreds of U.S. police agencies.
Internal ATF records show at least 52,529 police guns turned up at crime scenes since 2006, the earliest year data is available from the government.
CBS News journalists surveyed state and local law enforcement agencies coast to coast and found at least 145 agencies resold their guns between 2006 and 2022. That's about 90% of the agencies that responded.
Many of the police agencies that resold or traded in their weapons were the same ones who routinely hold gun buyback events they say are aimed at reducing the number of guns on the street.
The Philadelphia Police Department boasts on its website of having collected 825 guns in buybacks since 2021.
But records obtained in the CBS News investigation show the agency resold at least 886 of its officers' former duty guns over the past two decades.
The Newark Police Department staged a buyback in 2021, offering $250 for each firearm. People turned in 146 guns.
""Without question, 146 fewer firearms on our streets means less gun violence, fewer gun violence victims, and less risk of suicide or death,"" public safety director Brian O'Hara said in a YouTube post.
Five years earlier, the Newark agency resold more than five times that number of guns — nearly 1,000. One ended up in Pittsburgh, where police seized it from a convicted felon in 2019 after he allegedly fired more than a dozen shots in a neighborhood and then led officers on a foot chase.
A Newark Police spokesperson said the guns had been traded in as a cost-saving measure under a previous administration.
In 2003, Congress passed the Tiahrt Amendment. Named after the lawmaker who introduced it, Tiahrt bars the ATF from letting the public see most trace information about guns used in crimes.
ATF cited the Tiahrt amendment in rejecting a public records request filed in 2017 by our reporting partners on this project, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting.
Reveal sued. In 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled ATF had to release some of the summary statistical information.
The limited records released during that litigation showed more than 52,000 guns used in crimes had been traced back to law enforcement agencies. A small sample of the underlying data showed at least 800 different agencies' old firearms ended up at crime scenes.
Federal law enforcement agencies are legally required to destroy their used guns. State and local agencies make their own decisions.
Most sell or trade them in — but not all.
In Seattle, police stopped trading in handguns around 2016.
""If we're selling them out, we just don't know where those guns could end up,"" Police Chief Adrian Diaz said. ""We don't want to contribute to the problem.""
Indianapolis Police Chief Christopher Bailey told CBS News that his agency has historically traded in its weapons, but he would consider changing that policy after a recent shooting death involving a former police duty gun sold by a sheriff's office in California.
""I don't want any weapon that we owned to end up being used violently against another person,"" Bailey said.
After CBS News Minnesota showed Minneapolis police officials our findings, Police Chief Brian O'Hara said his department would change its policy.
""I don't want us to be in a position where a weapon that was once in service for the police department here is then winding up used in a crime, or in an act of violence against a person, or even to shoot a police officer,"" O'Hara said. ""So going forward, we're not going to be selling any weapons at all.""

ByGraham Kates
May 16, 2024 / 1:26 PM EDT/ CBS News
Former President Donald Trump often arrives at hisNew York criminal trialflanked by elected officials who choose to while away the hours sitting in a courtroom.
They sit in the first two rows of the court on Trump's side, a section reserved for his team. On the prosecution's side, the same section often has an empty seat, reserved for a public official who's mostly chosen to do other work during the trial: Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.
Bragg has attended portions of proceedings here and there, primarily on days when his own staff — including young paralegals — are called to testify as custodial witnesses and then are subject to defense grilling.
""Bragg is doing it the right way,"" said Domenic Trunfio, a Syracuse University law professor.
Trunfio ran the day-to-day operations of the Onandaga County district attorney's office in Syracuse for nearly two decades, with a jurisdiction of about half-a-million people, one-third the size of Manhattan. He said it's meaningful that Bragg shows up for his staff.
""It shows support. It says, 'Hey, I'm here. I know you're testifying in a case against the former president of the United States. And I'm here for you,'"" said Trunfio.
That was the case when paralegal Georgia Longstreet was challenged by Trump attorney Todd Blanche over whether she has independent knowledge of how X (formerly Twitter) or Trump's Truth Social network append timestamps to social media posts — or if she could affirmatively say who Trump was talking about when he posted, ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you!""
""I have my assumptions, but, no,"" Longstreet said, sitting some 10 feet from Trump.
And he watched as another Trump attorney, Emil Bove, asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider if creating phone call log charts was ""tedious"" work.
""Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it,"" said Jarmel-Schneider, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
""I hear that. Respect,"" Bove replied.
A spokesperson for Bragg declined comment for this story.
Trump has entered a not guilty plea in the case, in which he'scharged with 34 felony countsof falsifying business records. The documents were allegedly meant to hide ""hush money"" payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who at the time agreed not to speak publicly about a sexual encounter that Trump denies.
Bragg has attended parts of about one-third of the trial's 18 days, but even that level of attendance is extraordinarily rare for a Manhattan D.A., according to Diana Florence, who worked for Bragg's two predecessors.
""In my 25-year career, where I did a lot of high profile cases, the D.A. came to my summations a couple of times and to opening statements a couple of times,"" Florence said. ""But generally speaking, that wasn't really something they would do.""
Florence said D.A.s are typically too busy with other aspects of the job to sit in on trials, such as pushing legislation relevant to law enforcement or their office and reviewing other major cases coming before grand juries.
Bragg has done both in the last month. Among other things, he championed an update to New York's hate crimes legislation that was included in the state's fiscal year 2025 budget, sent a letterasking YouTubeto modify algorithms that he said recommended videos to kids about how to make ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, and he joined a push for a bill that would allow prosecutors to more easily introduce evidence in sex crimes cases that show defendants' prior ""bad acts.""
That bill was inspired by an April 25 New York Court of Appeals decisionoverturning the rape convictionof former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
His office has also announced major indictments, including ones related to the murder of a man shoved in front of a subway, sex trafficking, a large-scale retail theft ring and a notorious landlord accused of harassing his tenants.
Florence and Trunfio said for big cases like those, as well as the Weinstein case and of course, the Trump case, prosecutors need the D.A.'s buy-in. Ultimately, it's his name on the indictment.
""The elephant in the room here is this is the biggest criminal case that anybody has seen in a century,"" said Trunfio.

ByMadeleine May,Caitlin Huey-Burns
Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 8:05 PM EDT/ CBS News
Reno— Washoe County, Nevada, is a battleground county in a critical battleground state and may hold the keys to congressional contests, and potentially the presidency. But in this cycle, one of the most consequential races in the state is that of county commissioner.
That commissioner would wield the swing vote on a panel that — among other responsibilities — oversees elections in Washoe. Members appoint the county's top election official, set the budget for elections and ultimately certify statewide election results.
""It's important to realize that we are in a national election, that national election is being run at the local level,"" said Democratic Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar in an interview. ""And at that local level, they can completely shut down the election at the state, for the state and for the nation.""
At a time when the electoral process has come under withering attack by former President Donald Trump and his boisterous MAGA following, control of the elections has emerged as a target of his allies in places like Washoe County, despite a persistent lack of evidence of widespread voter fraud in Washoe, or any other county in the U.S.
A new CBS News investigation found there are nearly 80 officials working in election oversight positions across seven battleground states, including Nevada, who don't believe the 2020 election results, refused to certify the election, publicly supported the actions taken onJan. 6, 2021 in the U.S. Capitol riotsor have pushed election conspiracies.
In Washoe, the power of the commission has attracted the attention of a powerful and wealthy right-wing activist named Robert Beadles, who has falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged. Since 2022, he has been lobbying in support of controversial voting changes introduced by other Commissioners, which include eliminating voting machines in favor of hand-counting paper ballots and having the National Guard at polling places — steps the ACLU has called ""categorically illegal.""
Beadles, who says he made his fortune in real estate and cryptocurrency, has spent significantly in local elections for school board, city council and the state legislature. He has also spent over $100,000 on commission races, particularly in support of two of the five current commissioners, Jeannie Herman and Michael Clark,both of whomhave pushed election conspiracies or denied that Joe Biden won the election. This cycle, he aims to build a majority on the commission to promote his agenda.
""We have our two superheros on the county commission. We have Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman."" Beadles said in a video posted to his Facebook. ""However, those two votes are not enough. We need three.""
""If you want to save a county, you save the county commission, because they're the ones with one vote that can fix or destroy the county,"" Beadles told CBS News at a local Republican event he was moderating. ""People are looking at the president and Senate and all those types and that's great, but that one person can't necessarily make a difference. As much as one person in the county commission or city council can, they could sway the entire board.""
In his pursuit of one more vote on the county commission, Beadles has targeted fellow Republican and a current commissioner, Clara Andriola, for defeat in the upcoming June primary. Andriola has held the line against the voting changes Beadles has proposed — which contributed to her censure by the Washoe County GOP — where Beadles serves on the executive committee. That committee alsopassed a resolutionin 2022 claiming that President Biden was not legitimately elected.
""It was disappointing. It was hurtful … but I am a Republican, I still am a Republican and I will vote as a Republican,"" Andriola said of the censure. When asked how she thinks elections are run in Washoe, Andriola told CBS News. ""I think elections have been run as best as we can.""
But for Beadles, Andriola is not Republican enough. Instead, he is backing several other Republican candidates, including Andriola's primary opponent, Republican Tracey Hilton-Thomas. In an interview with CBS, during a campaign stop, Hilton-Thomas says she works closely with Beadles and current Republican Commissioner to draft new election resolutions.
""I do believe that there is interference in our elections,"" said Hilton-Thomas. When asked whether she believed the results of the 2020 election, she said: ""I would have to say at this time, no, I do not believe the results … they won't show us, they won't show us the proof, we have to just trust their word. And I'm not a person that trusts people's word.""
Beadles has continued to peddle false claims about election fraud. In 2022, hetoldthe Washoe County Commission that ""the elections are rigged … it's treason, you all are committing treason."" He directed much of his ire about the election at County Registrar Deanna Spikula, who laterresignedher position after facing an onslaught of harassment. Beadles has denied any responsibility for the harassment of Spikula or other officials.
Beadles filed a lawsuit to try and block the The Election Worker Protection Act, which makes it a felony to harass, threaten or intimidate election workers. The suit has twice been rejected in federal court, but Beadlesfiledanother appeal earlier this month.  A public affairs officer with Washoe County Commissions said there has been a 100% turnover of election officials in that office since 2020.
The Reno activist has been promoted bySteve Bannon, a former top adviser to Donald Trump.
""They're really scared of Trump, but what they should be scared of is like 25 (million) to 100 million little Trump 2.0s running around the country,"" Beadles said on Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast.
In the June 11 primary, Washoe County voters will decide whether or not to vote out Andriola. And if Beadles is successful in getting one more vote on the commission, his allies will be in charge of certifying elections in the future.
Aguilar, the Nevada secretary of state, says election deniers ""understand the power of a county at the national level … Nevada is a battleground state, we are going to be part of a small group of states who determines the next president of the United States. And when you start to break down the data in the information county by county, you start to recognize the power of Washoe.""

May 17, 2024 / 11:45 AM EDT/ CBS/AP
A mayoral candidate and five other people were killed when people opened fire at a campaign rally in southern Mexico state of Chiapas, officials said, marking yet another shooting in an area known as a trafficking route for migrant and drug smuggling that has been hit bycartel turf battles.
State prosecutors saida young girl was among the six people killed in the gunfire late Thursday, along with mayoral candidate Lucero López Maza. Two people also were wounded.
""A confrontation broke out between armed civilians during a political campaign event,"" prosecutors said in a statement.
It was unclear whether López Maza was the intended target of the attack, because shootings have become so common and widespread in the area.
The mass shooting occurred at a crossroads in the rural town of La Concordia, Chiapas, about 80 miles from the border with Guatemala.
The area near the Guatemalan border is a major smuggling route for drugs and migrants, and smiMexico's two main drug cartels have been fighting for control of the region.
On Tuesday,11 people were killedin mass shootings in a village in the township of Chicomuselo, Chiapas, a few dozen miles away from La Concordia.
Chiapas draws tourists with its lush jungle, Indigenous communities and ancient Mayan ruins.
But the border area has been plagued by violence as the rivalSinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartelsbattle for territory. Just last month,masked men stopped a vehiclecarrying Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Claudia Sheinbaum, while she was traveling between campaign stops to ask that she address the violence in Chiapas if she wins the June 2 election.
About 20 Mexican political candidates have been killed so far in 2024 before next month's elections — including one mayoral hopeful who wasshot dead last monthjust as she began campaigning.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-masking-bill-pandemic-coronavirus-crime-campus-protest/,"Bill to ban most public mask wearing, including for health reasons, advances in North Carolina",U.S.,"Watch CBS News
Updated on:  May 17, 2024 / 9:10 AM EDT/ AP
Republican lawmakers in North Carolina are pushing forward with their plan to repeal a pandemic-era law that allowed thewearing of masksin public for health reasons, a move spurred in part by demonstrationsagainst the war in Gazathat have included masked protesterscamped out on college campuses.
The legislation cleared the Senate on Wednesday in a 30-15 vote along party lines despite several attempts by state Senate Democrats to change the bill. The bill, which would raise penalties for someone who wears a mask while committing a crime, including arrested protesters, could still be altered as it heads back to the House.
Opponents of the bill say it risks the health of thosemasking for safety reasons. But those backing the legislation say it is a needed response to the demonstrations, including those at theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hillthat escalated to police clashes and arrests.
The bill also further criminalizes the blockage of roads or emergency vehicles for a protest, which has occurred during pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Raleigh and Durham.
""It's about time that the craziness is put, at least slowed down, if not put to a stop,"" Wilson County Republican Sen. Buck Newton, who presented the bill, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.
Most of the pushback against the bill has centered around its removal of health and safety exemptions for wearing a mask in public. Thehealth exemption was addedat the start of the COVID-19 pandemic along largely bipartisan lines.
This strikethrough would return public masking rules to their pre-pandemic form, which were created in 1953 to address a different issue: limiting Ku Klux Klan activity in North Carolina, according to a2012 bookby Washington University in St. Louis sociology professor David Cunningham.
Since the pandemic, masks have become a partisan flashpoint — and Senate debate on if the law would make it illegal to mask for health purposes was no different.
Democratic lawmakers repeated their unease about how removing protections for people who choose to mask for their health could put immunocompromised North Carolinians at risk of breaking the law. Legislative staff said during a Tuesday committee that masking for health purposes would violate the law.
""You're making careful people into criminals with this bill,"" Democratic Sen. Natasha Marcus of Mecklenburg County said on the Senate floor. ""It's a bad law.""
Simone Hetherington, an immunocompromised person who spoke during Wednesday's Senate Rules Committee, said masking is one of the only ways she can protect herself from illnesses and fears the law would prevent that practice.
""We live in different times and I do receive harassment,"" Hetherington said about her mask wearing. ""It only takes one bad actor.""
But Republican legislators continued to express doubt that someone would get in legal trouble for masking because of health concerns, saying law enforcement and prosecutors would use discretion on whether to charge someone. Newton said the bill focuses on criminalizing masks only for the purpose of concealing one's identity.
""I smell politics on the other side of the aisle when they're scaring people to death about a bill that is only going to criminalize people who are trying to hide their identity so they can do something wrong,"" Newton said.
Three Senate Democrats proposed amendments to keep the health exemption and exclude hate groups from masking, but Senate Republicans used a procedural mechanism to block them without going up for a vote.
Future changes to the bill could be a possibility, but it would ultimately be up to the House, Newton told reporters after the vote. Robeson County Republican Sen. Danny Britt also said during an earlier committee that he anticipated ""some tweaking.""
House Rules Committee Chairman Destin Hall, a Caldwell County House Republican, told reporters before the Senate vote that the House planned to ""take a look at it"" but members wanted to clamp down on people who wear masks while committing crimes.
The masking bill will likely move through a few committees before hitting the House floor, which could take one or two weeks, Hall said.

ByLi Cohen
May 16, 2024 / 9:59 AM EDT/ CBS News
The ""grotesque"" baobab tree has long been known as the ""tree of life"" for its ability to create and maintain its own ecosystem in arid regions. Since the time of the ancient Egyptians, people have marveled at what researchers say is among ""the most charismatic species on our planet,"" but nobody knew where they originated from – until now.
There are currently eight species of the tall and wide-trunked plants, also known as upside-down trees or ""mother of the forest."" Of these groups, six species are found on Madagascar, one is found across continental Africa and another is found only in northwestern Australia.
But only one of those locations is the true origin of them all.
Researchers say they solved the mystery of the ""spectacular trees"" using the species' DNA . In a new study published inNature, they said all the trees came from the African island nation of Madagascar.
Baobabs have ""captivated botanists, tourists, naturalists and passers-by for centuries,"" the study says. ""Probably the earliest record of humans marvelling at these amazing trees can be traced back to the Ancient Egyptians, around 2,300 BC. With their grotesque appearance, enormous size, reputed longevity and diverse uses, baobabs have become one of the most charismatic species on our planet.""
Nailing down that charisma was difficult. But researchers say that after picking leaves off the species and analyzing genomes, they were able to determine that their common ancestor was based in Madagascar. Over time, members of the species were radiated off the island, making hybrid species that would evolve to have different flowers that attract various other animals.
""We were delighted to be involved in this project uncovering patterns of baobab speciation in Madagascar followed by the astonishing long-distance dispersal of two species, one to Africa and another to Australia,""Queen Mary University of Londonprofessor Andrew Leitch said. ""This was accompanied by the evolution of some fascinating pollination syndromes involving hawkmoths, lemurs and bats.""
According to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, baobabs are ""like no other.""
""A thick, bottle-like trunk rises to support spindly branches. Baobabs are deciduous, and during the dry season (which can last up to nine months), the bare branches of a baobab resemble a gnarled root system, and make these trees look as if they were pulled up by the roots and pushed back in upside down,"" the organization says.
The alliance says that the trees not only serve a key role in their ecosystems, but create their own. Along with helping soil stay humid, recycle nutrients and prevent erosion, they also provide food, water and shelter to other species.
The smallest of the baobab species grows to 16 feet, while the largest of the trees can grow to be about 82 feet tall, with a circumference that measures the same, or even more. For comparison, a semitruck is typically around72 feet long.
But many of these trees are facing a conservation battle. All but one of the species is including the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with three considered to be threatened with extinction, one considered critically endangered and another considered endangered, the study says. Only one species is classified ""least concern,"" although itspopulations are declining.
The DNA findings show that some of the trees have low genetic diversity, a key component of species' survival as it helps establish resilience to environmental changes. Their findings also suggest climate change ""will pose severe threats"" to one of the Madagascar-based species and could force it to go extinct before 2080. Based on this, study researchers say that their findings should be cause for re-evaluation of the conservation status of the baobabs.
The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also noted a ""rapid increase"" in deaths of the trees in southern Africa.
""Of the continent's 13 largest baobabs, 9 have collapsed and died,"" the group said. ""The cause is unclear, but scientists suspect that global climate change may be playing a role in the demise of these trees.""

Updated on:  May 8, 2024 / 1:41 PM EDT/ CBS News
The trend of teens and tweensobsessing over skin careis ""at its max,"" says Dr. Sheilagh Maguiness, a dermatologist and president ofSociety for Pediatric Dermatology— and that can mean both good and bad for young people.
""(They are) heading to Sephora and Ulta Beauty in droves to try to get their hands on what they think is trendy,"" she tells CBS News.
While the focus on skin care routines at a young age may have some benefits, for example by encouraging young people to establish healthy habits early on, there are also risks, experts warn.
""What's not good about caring for your skin, washing your face, wanting to establish good healthy skin care habits early? That's great,"" Maguiness says. ""But what's not great is the fact that some of the products that are being marketed to tweens and teens are not necessarily good or appropriate for their skin.""
Social media is a driving factor in influencing this age group toward skin care, saysDr. Usha Rajagopal, medical director of the San Francisco Plastic Surgery and Laser Center.
Maguiness agrees, pointing to celebrities and ""skinfluencers"" posting about ""long, complicated skin careregimenswith all these really fancy, expensive products ... that (tweens) might think is really good for their skin.""
Plus, tweens ""have alway been collectors,"" Maguiness adds. While past generations may have collected Beanie Babies, ""skin care is really the hip trend right now.""
""They are being marketed to buy products that have bright packaging, that look really cool and trendy and would really appeal to tweens,"" she adds. ""It's fun, it's cute. But in those packages are products that are very strong. ... No 12-year-old needs a retinol.""
Here are some expert-backed do's and don'ts:
Do: Wash your face
""Washing your face with a gentle cleanser once or twice a day — that's a great first step around age 11 or 12,"" Maguiness says. ""Even tweens could could wash their face twice a day; as young as 8, that would be just fine.""
Do: Use sun protection
Rajagopal says younger patients are now more aware of the importance ofpreventing sun damage.
""That is amazing because not only would it help with sun damage, wrinkles, etc. cosmetically, but certainly the biggest one isreducing skin cancer risks,"" she says.
After washing your face in the morning, Maguiness suggests applying asunscreen with SPF 30or greater. Then in the evening, swap that out for a gentle moisturizer.
""The only preventative product that you need in an arsenal at any age is sunscreen,"" Maguiness adds. ""It is the number one thing you can do to prevent your skin from aging and to prevent, even more importantly, the risk for skin cancer down the line.""
Do: Talk to your dermatologist
Beyond a face wash, moisturizer and sunscreen, dermatologists can discuss the best, most appropriate options for any skin concerns young people may have. For example, acne as tweens and teens get older is something that can be treated — but it's best to talk to a professional about the most safe and effective options.
Rajagopal also hopes physicians are talking to young people about good general health and its impact on skin — like not smoking, for example. ""Because that can actually increase wrinkles over your face and make you look 10 years older,"" she explains.
Don't: Go overboard
Some products can do more harm than good for young skin, especially if overused.
""In my clinic, what I see is these teen girls coming in with bags of products that they're using, and ... they're actually damaging their skin barrier. They're drying themselves out. They're getting irritant dermatitis and they're using products that really just aren't appropriate for the type of skin that they have,"" Maguiness says.
Some harsh ingredients for young people to avoid include alpha and beta hydroxy acids (AHA and BHA), alcohol, highly-fragranced products, and retinols and retinoids, plastic surgeon Dr. Smita Ramanadham, recentlytold CBS New York.
""The biggest category to really avoid are those anti-aging products,"" she says. ""Young skin just does not need it. Young skin has collagen, elastin, it is hydrated, so we don't need to add these extra ingredients that are really going to irritate and cause inflammation.""
Don't: Ignore your mental health
Experts recognize there's a mental health component here too.
""Standing in front of the sink for an hour participating in a multi-step regimen might be putting unnecessary emphasis on appearance ... that in and of itself isn't healthy,"" Maguiness says, noting that some psychologists are worried that this might start an unhealthy fixation with the desire to look younger or a general emphasis on looks.
Plus, skin issues likeacne can impact self-esteemand mental health too.
And it's not just girls — boys are part of the skin care craze too, but are often left out of the conversation.
""There's a stigma surrounding self-care for boys and that was something that I really felt, as a mom to two tween boys and a doctor, that I wanted to address,"" said Maguiness, who created skin care company Stryke Club to address this gap in the industry.
Some also worry about whether kids focusing on skin care at an early age will translate to more extreme cosmetic procedures down the line.
Rajagopal says she's already seeing a newer, younger age group coming in for injectable treatments like Botox around their mid-20s — though it's approved for anyone 18 and older. She warns that going overboard on other popular procedures like lip fillers, for example, can sometimes result in the opposite of the desired effect.
""Sometimes social media does skew the way they think people should look,"" she explains. ""Hopefully, young people will ease on the very dramatic look. When they do it so early, it actually ages them. They look much older than they really are. Instead of seeing a young, youthful, fresh 25-year-old they look like they're 38.""

Washington —President Biden asserted executive privilege over audio recordings from an investigation into his handling of classified documents, a top Justice Department official revealed in a letter to House committee leaders obtained by CBS News.
The assertion came at the recommendation of the Justice Department, as the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees were slated to move forward with markups of acontempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Merrick Garlandon Thursday for defying their request for audio recordings from an October 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur that came as part of the classified documents case against Mr. Biden.
""While our cooperation with Congress has been extraordinary, we also have a responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality of law enforcement files where disclosure would jeopardize future investigations,"" Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte wrote Thursday, ""The Attorney General must draw a line that safeguards the Department from improper political influence and protects our principles, our law enforcement work, and the people who carry out that work independently.""
The Justice Department contends that it ""made substantial efforts"" to respond to the congressional committees' requests for information and materials following Hur's investigation into the president's past handling of classified records, adding they had already handed over the transcripts of the two interviews of which the audio recordings are now at issue.
""The Committees have still not identified a remaining need for these audio files,"" Uriarte argued.
CBS News and other outlets have sued for access to the recordings.
The response and upcoming vote could launch the two branches into an election-year legal fight over the tapes, one in which the White House and Justice Department would be forced to justify handing over the transcripts to Congress and drawing a line on the audio recordings of the president.
""We have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the committees get responses to their legitimate requests,"" Garland said in brief remarks to reporters Thursday morning. ""But this is not one.""
The legal basis for the president's assertion of executive privilege, according to another letter obtained by CBS News from the attorney general to Mr. Biden, came from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and Garland himself made the recommendation to the president.
""The Committees' needs are plainly insufficient to outweigh the deleterious effects that production of the recordings would have on the integrity and effectiveness of similar law enforcement investigations in the future,"" Garland wrote in a letter to the president dated May 15. ""I therefore respectfully request that you assert executive privilege over the subpoenaed recordings. I also request that you make a protective assertion of executive privilege with respect to any other materials responsive to the subpoenas that have not already been produced.""
The attorney general wrote that he feared turning over the tapes might risk chilling the cooperation of witnesses, including White House officials, in any future investigations. He said that risk outweighs the committee's request.
The White House Counsel's Office also responded to the upcoming contempt votes, writing to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer Thursday morning, alleging they would likely ""chop up"" and ""distort"" the recordings ""for partisan political purposes"" should they obtain them.
""Demanding such sensitive and constitutionally-protected law enforcement materials from the Executive Branch because you want to manipulate them for potential political gain is inappropriate,"" Edward Siskel wrote Thursday.
The move to assert executive privilege, which grants the executive branch the ability to withhold certain communications from the courts or Congress under the separation of powers doctrine, is expected to shield Garland from criminal proceedings. Garland noted in a letter that the Justice Department has a history of recognizing that executive privilege protects materials related to ""closed criminal investigation where disclosure is likely to damage future law enforcement efforts.""
The committee leaders have pressed forward, arguing that they require the recordings as part of their investigation into the president's handling of classified documents, while asserting that the White House has already waived privilege by releasing the transcripts. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer claimed in a statement that the White House fears releasing the audio recordings because it would ""reaffirm to the American people that President Biden's mental state is in decline.""
""Today's Hail Mary from the White House changes nothing for our committee,"" Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. ""The House Oversight Committee will move forward with its markup of a resolution and report recommending to the House of Representatives that Attorney General Garland be held in contempt of Congress for defying a lawful subpoena.""

The Biden campaign has accepted CBS News' invitation to participate in a vice presidential debate this summer.
The Biden campaign says that either the proposed dates of Tuesday, July 23, or Tuesday, August 13 would be acceptable for Vice President Kamala Harris to debate. The Trump campaign has not yet publicly accepted the invitation. And former President Donald Trump has not yet named a running mate.
""We look forward to the Trump campaign accepting one of these dates so that the full debate calendar for this campaign can be set,"" Brian Fallon, campaign communications director for Harris, told reporters.
CBS News confirmed that President Biden's campaign accepted its offer to host a vice presidential debate and has extended the same offer to Trump's campaign.
Mr. Biden and Trumphave agreedto presidential debates on June 27 and Sept. 10. Plans for the debates came together quickly after the president's campaign said in a letter that he was willing to debate his Republican opponent twice before the November election. That kicked off a series of competing proposals and social media posts from the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, culminating in the two debates being scheduled for June and September within a matter of hours.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, apotential running mate pickfor Trump, alluded to potentially participating in a debate during an interview Wednesday night.
""I hear there's a debate in July. If you're the guy moderating, maybe I'll be talking to you. We'll see what happens,"" Scott told Newsmax.
Democratic strategists argued an earlier start date for the debates would help the Biden campaign establish the contrasts between the president and Trump in front of a wider audience and that it could offset some of the disadvantages Biden has in polling.
""It's important to start attacking [Trump] one-on-one early. We have all the advantages, so the earlier the better,"" said Quentin James, president of The Collective PAC, a committee supporting Black candidates that has endorsed Mr. Biden.

ByKaia Hubbard
Updated on:  May 14, 2024 / 10:58 PM EDT/ CBS News
Washington —Prince George's County Executive  Angela Alsobrooks has won the Maryland Democratic Senate primary, CBS News projects. Alsobrooks will face former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who was projected to win the GOP primary for the open seat in a race that could tip the balance of power in the Senate.
Alsobrooks and Rep. David Trone faced off in a brutal and costly race for the Democratic nomination, which kicked off after Democratic Sen. Ben Cardinannouncedlast year that he would retire. The contest teed up a competitive general election fight, where Alsobrooks will face off against the popular former governor as the party seeks to hold on to the seat in November.
Although Maryland is a deep blue state, Hogan's late entrance into the race in February cast an easy victory for Democrats into question, making a GOP flip of the seat possible as Democrats fight to hang on to their narrow majority in the chamber.
The two leading Democrats had been engaged in a bruising primary contest that divided Democratic leaders in Congress. Trone and Alsobrooks traded attacks in recent weeks in the closely watched race, and heading into the primary, the two appeared neck and neck in thepolls.
In apostto social media Tuesday night, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks on her primary win and said he looks ""forward to a real debate on what this campaign is about: who can actually help fix the mess in Washington.""
Alsobrooks, 53, currently serves as Prince George's County executive. The former prosecutor would be the first Black woman to represent Maryland in the Senate, and just the fourth Black woman to serve in the Senate in its history.
The favorite of Maryland's Democratic establishment coming into Tuesday, Alsobrooks had the backing of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Steny Hoyer and Jamie Raskin.
Following Alsobrooks' win Tuesday night, Moore said on social media she was ""the best choice to beat Larry Hogan in November.""
Earlier this month on ""America Decides,"" Alsobrookssaidof her numerous supporters, ""This is a people-powered race, as it should be.""
When it comes to taking on Hogan in November, Alsobrooks said that the former governor has a ""record that he will have to defend,"" pointing to his record on abortion, among other things, which she's made a central tenet of her campaign.
""These are issues that are core to Marylanders,"" she said. ""And they are issues that I think will mean in the fall that we will prevail in keeping the Democratic party in control in the Senate.""
Alsobrooks defeated Trone, 68, who has served in the House since 2019. With deep pockets as the owner of alcohol retailer Total Wine & More, Trone dropped tens of millions into the race, smashing records for personal funding in a primary.
HetoldCBS Baltimore that he was willing to fund his own campaign in order to keep his independence, ""so I'm not owned by Exxon; I'm not owned by Pfizer."" The third-term congressman also touted his ability to work across the aisle, with an emphasis on addressing issues like opioid addiction. He had the backing of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, along with fellow members of House Democratic leadership, Reps. Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar.
Moore on Tuesday night said he was glad Trone ""raised his hand to serve, and for the continued work he provides Maryland.""
""Dems across the state will be united to beat a Republican rubber stamp, the Old Governor, Larry Hogan,"" Moore added.
Hogan'ssurpriseentrance into the race in February introduced a major challenge for Democrats looking to hold onto their one-seat majority in the Senate.
A Republican win in Maryland could doom Democrats' majority in the chamber. And even before Hogan's announcement, Democrats faced steep odds of holding the majority. Though Republicans are defending 10 safely red seats, three Democrats are up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2020. And in another five states considered swing states, Democrats' reelection isn't guaranteed.
Hogan's bid now threatens what seemed to be a relatively safe Democratic Maryland Senate seat. The former governor, now 67, who served from 2015 to 2023, is still very popular in the state, having recently left office with approval ratings in the 70s, and he still enjoys widespread name recognition in the state. Should Hogan win in November, it would mark the first time a Republican has won a Maryland Senate seat in nearly four decades.

ByGraham Kates
May 16, 2024 / 1:26 PM EDT/ CBS News
Former President Donald Trump often arrives at hisNew York criminal trialflanked by elected officials who choose to while away the hours sitting in a courtroom.
They sit in the first two rows of the court on Trump's side, a section reserved for his team. On the prosecution's side, the same section often has an empty seat, reserved for a public official who's mostly chosen to do other work during the trial: Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.
Bragg has attended portions of proceedings here and there, primarily on days when his own staff — including young paralegals — are called to testify as custodial witnesses and then are subject to defense grilling.
""Bragg is doing it the right way,"" said Domenic Trunfio, a Syracuse University law professor.
Trunfio ran the day-to-day operations of the Onandaga County district attorney's office in Syracuse for nearly two decades, with a jurisdiction of about half-a-million people, one-third the size of Manhattan. He said it's meaningful that Bragg shows up for his staff.
""It shows support. It says, 'Hey, I'm here. I know you're testifying in a case against the former president of the United States. And I'm here for you,'"" said Trunfio.
That was the case when paralegal Georgia Longstreet was challenged by Trump attorney Todd Blanche over whether she has independent knowledge of how X (formerly Twitter) or Trump's Truth Social network append timestamps to social media posts — or if she could affirmatively say who Trump was talking about when he posted, ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you!""
""I have my assumptions, but, no,"" Longstreet said, sitting some 10 feet from Trump.
And he watched as another Trump attorney, Emil Bove, asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider if creating phone call log charts was ""tedious"" work.
""Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it,"" said Jarmel-Schneider, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
""I hear that. Respect,"" Bove replied.
A spokesperson for Bragg declined comment for this story.
Trump has entered a not guilty plea in the case, in which he'scharged with 34 felony countsof falsifying business records. The documents were allegedly meant to hide ""hush money"" payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who at the time agreed not to speak publicly about a sexual encounter that Trump denies.
Bragg has attended parts of about one-third of the trial's 18 days, but even that level of attendance is extraordinarily rare for a Manhattan D.A., according to Diana Florence, who worked for Bragg's two predecessors.
""In my 25-year career, where I did a lot of high profile cases, the D.A. came to my summations a couple of times and to opening statements a couple of times,"" Florence said. ""But generally speaking, that wasn't really something they would do.""
Florence said D.A.s are typically too busy with other aspects of the job to sit in on trials, such as pushing legislation relevant to law enforcement or their office and reviewing other major cases coming before grand juries.
Bragg has done both in the last month. Among other things, he championed an update to New York's hate crimes legislation that was included in the state's fiscal year 2025 budget, sent a letterasking YouTubeto modify algorithms that he said recommended videos to kids about how to make ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, and he joined a push for a bill that would allow prosecutors to more easily introduce evidence in sex crimes cases that show defendants' prior ""bad acts.""
That bill was inspired by an April 25 New York Court of Appeals decisionoverturning the rape convictionof former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
His office has also announced major indictments, including ones related to the murder of a man shoved in front of a subway, sex trafficking, a large-scale retail theft ring and a notorious landlord accused of harassing his tenants.
Florence and Trunfio said for big cases like those, as well as the Weinstein case and of course, the Trump case, prosecutors need the D.A.'s buy-in. Ultimately, it's his name on the indictment.
""The elephant in the room here is this is the biggest criminal case that anybody has seen in a century,"" said Trunfio.

A New York court on Tuesday rejected former President Donald Trump's bid to lift the gag order limiting what he can say about those involved in his ongoing criminal trial, saying the order does not violate Trump's First Amendment rights.
Justice Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump's trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records,issued the original orderin March, barring Trump from discussing likely witnesses, jurors, attorneys and court staff involved in the case. Merchan laterexpandedit to apply to his daughter.
Trump was not prevented from criticizing Merchan or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
In afive-page rulingon Tuesday, the appellate division, first department of the New York Supreme Court, found that Merchan ""properly determined that [Trump's] public statements posed a significant threat to the integrity of the testimony of witnesses and potential witnesses in this case.""
""We find that Justice Merchan properly weighed petitioner's First Amendment Rights against the court's historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, and the right of persons related or tangentially related to the criminal proceedings from being free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm,"" the ruling said.
Merchan hasheld Trump in contempt of courtfor violating the order 10 times. Last week, he warned Trump that he could be sent to jail for future violations.
The latest violation concerned comments Trump made about the political make-up of the jury. In a written order on May 6, Merchan said Trump's comments ""not only called into question the integrity, and therefore the legitimacy of these proceedings, but again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.""
Trump's attorney Todd Blancheasked Merchanto modify the gag order in court last week to allow Trump to ""respond publicly to what happened in court the last day and a half,"" referring to testimony by Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who received $130,000 in 2016 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.
Merchan rejected Blanche's request, saying the order is in place ""because of the nature of the attacks, the vitriol"" from Trump.
""Your client's track record speaks for itself,"" Merchan said.

Washington— Sixty law enforcement officers across the country were feloniously killed in the line of duty last year — a decrease of one from the year prior — but assaults on officers in the field are on the rise, driven by increases in gun violence, according to an FBI report released Tuesday.
The statistics were collected from law enforcement agencies across the country — including state, local, and tribal precincts — and showed a slight decrease in overall officer deaths, continuing the downward trend from the recent high in 2021 of 73 officers killed in the line of duty.
Still, according to the report, the last three years (2021-2023) saw the highest collective number of law enforcement deaths ""than any other consecutive 3-year period in the past 20 years.""
In all, 52% of the officers who were killed in the line of duty died from a gunshot wound in 2023, a slight increase from 2022, and firearms were the most commonly used weapons. More officers were killed in the South, which is the largest region in the country, than in any other part of the U.S., the FBI said, although the South did see a significant decrease in overall officer deaths — 20 in 2023 compared to 32 in 2022.
An FBI officIal told reporters Tuesday that although the number of officers killed in action over the last three years has dropped, there has at the same time been a steady rise in assaults on law enforcement. The official said the FBI is working to understand the underlying reasons for that inverse trend.
Based on preliminary data, according to the report, ""10,884 agencies employing 600,120 officers reported 79,091 assaults of officers, indicating a rate of 13.2 assaults per 100 officers.""
In 2023, the number of law enforcement officers assaulted by firearms reached about 466, a 10-year high, the FBI said.
The report's release comes as the nation marks National Police Week. On Monday night, Attorney General Merrick Garland and other law enforcement leaders attended a candlelight vigil on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to honor fallen law enforcement officers throughout the country.
Last month, four members of a U.S. Marshals Service task force wereshot and killedtrying to arrest a fugitive wanted for firearms charges. In all, eight officers were shot.
One suspect died on the scene and two others were taken into custody.
Speaking at a memorial for Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas Weeks, one of the fallen, earlier this month, Garland said the officers' deaths ""stand as a stark reminder of the enormous risks our law enforcement officers face every day, even when making the relatively routine arrests they make every day.""
""Every day our law enforcement officers go to work knowing that day may be their last. Every day their families send them off to work, praying it will not be.""

ByGraham Kates
Updated on:  April 25, 2024 / 4:14 PM EDT/ CBS News
A federal judge has denied former President Donald Trump's request for a new trial in the civil suit brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, who was awarded an $83.3 million judgment by a jury thatfound Trump liable for defamationin January.
The judge also denied a request to strike the damages in the case, which Trump had called ""entirely out of proportion"" with Carroll's reputational injury.
""Mr. Trump's argument is entirely without merit both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact,"" U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in an18-page decisionThursday.
Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll who is unrelated to the judge, said she is ""pleased with though not surprised by"" the decision.
""It was entirely reasonable for the jury to award E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages given Donald Trump's continued defamation of Ms. Carroll during the trial itself, as well as his conduct in the courtroom where his 'hatred and disdain [were] on full display,'"" Kaplan said, quoting the judge's decision.
An attorney for Trump said he intends to appeal the decision.
""We categorically disagree with Judge Kaplan's decision,"" said Alina Habba. ""It ignores long-standing constitutional principles and is a prime example of the lawfare raging across this country. We are confident that this decision will be overturned by the Second Circuit.""
Trump requested the new trial in a March filing that listed grievances about the trial and pretrial decisions, including the exclusion of evidence related to Trump's ""state of mind"" when he defamed Carroll.
A longtime advice columnist, Carrollwrote a story in New York magazine in 2019accusing Trump of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.
Trump, who was president when the story was published, denied the allegations, calling Carroll a ""whack job"" and claiming he had never met her.
He claimed in his March filing that the jury couldn't have reasonably concluded Carroll suffered damages as a result of his comments, because they were made five hours after the story was published. Trump's attorneys pointed to a trickle of negative feedback Carroll received during that ""five-hour gap."" Carroll's attorneys said she was subject to a sustained deluge of derision and threats after Trump weighed in.
Trump claimed the jury's findings were based on ""'confusion, speculation or prejudice' as opposed to the 'evidence presented at trial.'""
Kaplan wrote that Trump's argument ignored that the jury and court concluded the statements Trump was sued over ""were false, defamatory, and made with both actual and common law malice.""
""It ignores the fact that those defamatory statements were viewed between at least 85 to 104 million times,"" Kaplan wrote.

BySara Moniuszko
Edited ByPaula Cohen
April 26, 2024 / 5:00 AM EDT/ CBS News
Fromsmart wearableslike theApple Watchor Garmintrackersto the celebrity-sportedOura ringand trendyWHOOP strap, health tech has come a long way from just tracking your steps.
""There's lots of different metrics now that we can begin to look at,"" says Dr. Davin Lundquist, family physician and chief medical officer at Augmedix. ""Anytime that we can have a greater awareness of our health and paying attention to it, it tends to influence behavior in a positive way.""
Here are four that doctors say can be useful to monitor:
Most healthy adults can benefit from sleep tracking to some level, says Dr. Carlos M. Nunez, chief medical officer at medical device company ResMed.
""Many users aren't tracking the right information and can end up fixating or misinterpreting the data rather than observing the larger trends that the trackers can help to indicate,"" Nunez says. ""Users should start by tracking their sleep-wake cycle to establish a consistent routine ofquality sleep, which research has shown can lead to improved concentration, increased productivity and feeling overall more positive.""
Tracking your heart rate can give you a picture into your heart health. The lower your resting heart rate, within reason, the healthier your heart is, explains Lundquist.
""If you're doing more aerobic exercise, over time, your resting heart rate should decline. And that would be an indication that your heart is getting healthier,"" he says.
""Certain devices can also provide insight into potential key health indicators - such as your respiratory rates, activity level and more,"" Nunez says. ""For some users, the data can also indicate how your body is responding to stress.""
Respiratory rate is a metric that may alert someone to other health issues, too. That's something Michael Snyder, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who has studied smartwatches, experienced firsthand after coming down withCOVID-19. Though he took a COVID test that came back negative, his own research app alerted him to sudden changes in his breathing and heart rates.
""I listened to my COVID test, and I should have listened my smartwatch,"" hetold CBS Newsin a 2022 interview.
Tracking metrics likecardiac rhythmmay help alert patients to a bigger problems.
""I had a patient whose Apple Watch told them that they had a run of atrial fibrillation,"" Lundquist said. ""We got this person into a cardiologist — sure enough, it was confirmed and the patient was adequately treated.""
""Afib (atrial fibrillation) is a big deal,"" cardiologist Dr. Tara Narulatold ""CBS Mornings"" in 2018as Apple rolled out electrocardiogram technology in its smartwatches to help detect the heart issue. ""It affects millions of Americans, increases hospitalization rates (and) increases death and heart failure.""
It also increases risk for potentially debilitating strokes by five times, she added.
""The problem with afib is that it can be asymptomatic, so you can be walking around and not know you have it while you're at increased risk of stroke,"" she explained, noting that a tracking device could help empower patients, but could also lead to false alarm: ""Anxiety, false positives, flooding doctors' offices with calls. There are definitely downsides, but I think this has the potential to really be very helpful down the road,""
Health trackers have come a long way, doctors says, but you shouldn't rely on these devices for 100% accuracy or diagnosis. The FDA has specificallywarned against any device that claimsto measure blood sugar without needles, since inaccuracies could lead to serious health consequences.
For other types of tracking, ""The accuracy of some of the smartwatches is still a little bit in question, although with each generation they're getting better. So I think overall, physicians are getting more confident in trusting these devices,"" Lundquist says. Plus, as he points out, users also have to take off the device to charge, meaning data won't be recorded 24/7.
While trackers can be a ""valuable tool for many,"" Nunez says the data shouldn't be used to diagnose serious sleep or health issues.
""Ultimately, sleep tracking devices can help to empower users to set and achieve health goals but are not a substitute for formal diagnosis or professional medical care,"" he says.
They can also help physicians partner with their patients, Lundquist says.
""As these applications become more mainstream, the ability to show up in your with your doctor's appointment, pull up your phone and show them your metrics would be a great way for us to partner with our patients and help them see where there's potential opportunities or problems,"" he says.

Wall Street advanced into uncharted territory on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 40,000 for the first time after a blowout earnings report from Walmart cast a positive light on the U.S. economy.
""The more important messaging from achieving one of these milestones is that corporate America is in pretty good shape,"" said Art Hogan, a managing director and chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ""It's like getting a gold star in school — guess what, things are OK.""
Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, noted that stocks have continued climbing as the U.S. seems headed for a so-calledsoft landingin which inflation recedes to more normal levels and economic growth remains healthy. Consumer spending and job gains, while slowing, also remain robust enough to stave off a prolonged slump even as the Federal Reserve pushes back its timeline for cutting its benchmark interest rate.
""Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all last year — now we are once again back to new highs,"" he said. ""Investors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history.""
The Dow hit the historic mark as Walmart jumped 7% after delivering robust first-quarter results. After hitting a high of 40,051, the index turned lower to close at 39,869, down 38.6 points, or 0.1%, on the day. The big-box retailer reported a large jump in e-commerce sales, as well as making inroads with high-income shoppers.
""These are not inflation-driven results,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts on an earnings call.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose to record heights before paring their gains, ending 0.2% and 0.3% lower.
A slowly cooling, but still resilient, economy has supported corporate earnings even as expectations of five or six interest rate cuts by the Fed this year have ebbed. Odds of a rate cut in September increased some after data released on Wednesday showeda slight moderation in consumer prices in April.
""The reestablishment of a disinflation trend in the coming months should allow the Fed to start easing policy in September,"" according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, who still expects Fed cuts of 50 basis points in total this year.
Lower rates are likely ahead as inflation ""drastically"" improves in the second half of 2024, according to Detrick at the Carson Group. ""It is an election year, so expect some bumps, but overall the bull market that stared in October 2022 is alive and well.""
From Hogan's perch, investors are just fine foregoing multiple rates cuts as long as the economy continues to perform and drive corporate earnings. As he put it: ""We're in a better place if we don't need the Fed to come to the rescue.""
While financial markets moved higher, so-called meme stocks are plummeting to earth. Shares of companies including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and Blackberry hadsurged earlier this weekafter a popular investor, know by his online handle ""Roaring Kitty,"" reappeared on social media after a long absence.

Updated on:  March 11, 2024 / 10:33 AM EDT/ CBS News
Ready or not,daylight saving time for 2024is here, which means we lost an hour of sleep. On Sunday, March 10, at 2 a.m., clocks in most of the United States and many other countries moved forward one hour and will stay there for nearly eight months of daylight saving time.
As opposed to""falling back"" in Novemberwhen we gain an hour, thistime changehas us ""spring forward,"" which means losing some sleep.
""As we move our clocks ahead, there's a jolt to the system,"" Dr. Beth Ann Malow, a neurology and pediatrics professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,told CBS Newslast spring, explaining this jolt can affect our sleep and overall health.
""Sleep really impacts our health in so many ways — our weight, our mood, our heart, our lungs, our brain — that's all affected bygood sleep,"" she says.
But there are ways to make shift less challenging, experts say. Here's how:
Taking steps to prepare for the time change is one way to conquer the daylight saving shift.
In the days leading up to the time change, try going to bed and waking up a little bit earlier than usual to prepare your body for the hour you will lose, Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital,previously told CBS News.
He also suggests avoiding afternooncaffeineandnapsduring this transition in order to increase your ability tofall asleepat night.
Daylight saving is also the time to prioritize your bedtime, Dr. Erin Flynn-Evans, a sleep expert and consultant to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM),told CBS Newsahead of last year's shift.
""Our bodies are going to want us to sleep in later relative to the clock after this, so if we don't go to bed early enough to allow for a full night of sleep, we're just going to be sort of chronically sleep deprived on top of the shift that we're experiencing,"" she explains. Bedtime routines are often viewed as being for children, but that adults can benefit too, ""this week more than any other,"" she adds.
And it's not just your bedtime routine — adjusting other daily routines that are ""time cues"" for your body, like mealtimes, for example, can help you get into the new rhythm, theAASM says.
""Light is what tells our body clock or circadian rhythm what time it is,"" Flynn-Evans explains. ""So by maximizing morning light and minimizing evening light, you should help your internal clock better adjust to this disruption that we force on ourselves twice a year.""
Sleep expert Dr. Shelby Harris recentlytold CBS New Yorkshe advises spending time outdoors the Sundayclocks change.
""Make sure you go for a gentle walk, do something exercise-wise. It doesn't have to be hardcore. Just movement and light exposure,"" she said.
The AASM also suggests heading outdoors for early morning sunlight the week after the time change.
Don't have time to make it outside?
Keep shades and curtains open for some natural morning light the next few days to get a head start on waking up a bit earlier, Flynn-Evans says. And Czeisler suggests eating breakfast in front of a window for an extra morning boost.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gaza-pier-us-built-aid-flowing-israel-rafah/,Aid starts flowing into Gaza Strip across temporary floating pier U.S. just finished building,World,"Watch CBS News
May 17, 2024 / 3:32 AM EDT/ CBS/AP
Washington— Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across anewly builttemporary U.S.floating pierinto the besieged enclave for the first time Friday as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hinder food and other supplies reaching people there.
The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day entering the Gaza Strip as Israelpresses in on the southern city of Rafahand its7-month offensive against Hamasrages on.
But the U.S. and aid groups also warn that the pier project isn't considered a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered Gaza on an average day.
The operation's success also remains tenuous due to the risk of militant attack, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which it killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel's offensive since then has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, officials of the Hamas-run Health Ministry say, while hundreds more have been killed in the West Bank.
The U.S. military's Central Command acknowledged the aid movement in a statement Friday, saying the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9 a.m. It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.
""This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organizations,"" the command said.
Photos released on Thursday by CENTCOM showed aid being hoisted onto a barge in the nearby Israeli port of Ashdod.
Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday. Hours later, the Pentagon said humanitarian aid would soon begin flowing and that no backups were expected in the distribution process, which is being coordinated by the United Nations.
The U.N., however, said fuel deliveries brought through land routes have all but stopped and this will make it extremely difficult to bring the aid to Gaza's people.
""We desperately need fuel,"" U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said. ""It doesn't matter how the aid comes, whether it's by sea or whether by land — without fuel, aid won't get to the people.""
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the issue of fuel deliveries comes up in all U.S. conversations with the Israelis. She also said the plan is to begin slowly with the sea route and ramp up the truck deliveries over time as they work the kinks out of the system.
Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has taken hold in Gaza's north.
Israel asserts it places no limits on the entry of humanitarian aid and blames the U.N. for delays in distributing goods entering Gaza. The U.N. says fighting, Israeli fire and chaotic security conditions have hindered delivery. Israel also fears Hamas will use the fuel in its fight against Israeli troops.
Under pressure from the U.S., Israel has in recent weeks opened a pair of crossings to deliver aid into hard-hit northern Gaza and said a series of Hamas attacks on the main crossing, Kerem Shalom, have disrupted the flow of goods. There have also been violent protests by Israelis disrupting aid shipments.
Israel recentlyseized the key Rafah border crossingin its push against Hamas around that city on the Egyptian border, raising fears about civilians' safety while also cutting off the main entry for aid into the Gaza Strip.
President Biden ordered the pier project, expected to cost $320 million. The boatloads of aid will be deposited at a port facility built by the Israelis just southwest of Gaza City and then distributed by aid groups.
U.S. officials said the initial shipment totaled as much as 500 tons of aid. The U.S. has closely coordinated with Israel on how to protect the ships and personnel working on the beach.
But there are still questions on how aid groups will safely operate in Gaza to distribute food, said Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, which is helping with logistics.
""There is a very insecure operating environment"" and aid groups are still struggling to get clearance for their planned movements in Gaza, Korde said.
The fear follows an Israeli strike last month thatkilled seven relief workers from World Central Kitchenwhose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, and the deaths of other aid personnel during the war.
Pentagon officials have made it clear that security conditions will be monitored closely and could prompt a shutdown of the maritime route, even just temporarily. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, a deputy commander at the U.S. military's Central Command, told reporters Thursday that ""we are confident in the ability of this security arrangement to protect those involved.""
Already, the site has been targeted by mortar fire during its construction, and Hamas has threatened to target any foreign forces who ""occupy"" the Gaza Strip.
Mr. Biden has made it clear that there will be no U.S. forces on the ground in Gaza, so third-country contractors will drive the trucks onto shore. Cooper said ""the United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.""
The World Food Program will be the U.N. agency handling the aid, officials said.
Israeli forces are in charge of security on shore, but there are also two U.S. Navy warships nearby that can protect U.S. troops and others.
The aid for the sea route is collected and inspected in Cyprus, then loaded onto ships and taken about 200 miles to the large floating pier built by the U.S. There, the pallets are transferred onto the trucks that then drive onto the Army boats. Once the trucks drop off the aid on shore, they immediately turn around the return to the boats.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scottie-scheffler-detained-police-pga-championship-not-following-orders-after-traffic-fatality-espn-report/,Scottie Scheffler arrested for allegedly assaulting officer near fatal crash while on way to PGA Championship,U.S.,"Watch CBS News
Updated on:  May 17, 2024 / 12:17 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Masters championScottie Schefflerwas detained by police in Louisville Friday morning on his way to the PGA Championship, withstunning imagesshowing him handcuffed as he was led to a police car and charged with assault after allegedly attempting to drive around traffic backed up from a pedestrian fatality investigation. Scheffler  was released later in the morning and continued competing in the tournament.
Police said Scheffler was booked for second-degree assault of a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic. In a statement to CBS News, Scheffler's attorney Steve Romines said the golfer ""never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle"" and added that ""we will litigate this matter as needed.""
In a statementposted to Instagram, Scheffler said he was in a ""very chaotic situation.""
""There was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,"" Scheffler said. ""I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today.""
Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world, later started the second round shortly after 10 a.m. EDT.
Police said a pedestrian had been struck by a bus while crossing the road in a lane that was dedicated to tournament traffic. Police said the man died at the scene, CBS affiliate WLKYreported. Traffic was backed up for about a mile in both directions on the only road that leads to Valhalla Golf Club, with dozens of police cars flashing red-and-blue lights near the entrance.
According to a police report, Scheffler was in an eastbound lane and pulled into the westbound lanes, where a uniformed detective was standing. The detective stopped Scheffler and attempted to give him instructions, but Scheffler ""refused to comply and accelerated forward,"" according to the report.
The detective, identified as Det. Gillis, was dragged ""to the ground"" and suffered ""pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist,"" according to the report.
The detective was dressed in a high visibility reflective jacket when he stopped Scheffler's car to give instructions, the arrest sheet said. Gillis was taken to the hospital for his injuries.
ESPN reporter Jeff Darlingtonsaid he watched this unfold. He said police pulled Scheffler out of the car, pushed him up against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.
""Scheffler was then walked over to the police car, placed in the back, in handcuffs, very stunned about what was happening, looked toward me as he was in those handcuffs and said, 'Please help me,'"" Darlington said. ""He very clearly did not know what was happening in the situation. It moved very quickly, very rapidly, very aggressively.""
Darlington said whole the incident started with a ""misunderstanding with traffic flow.""
The PGA of America identified the man who died as a worker with one of the association's vendors.
""This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship,"" the group said in a statement. ""We extend our sincere condolences to their family and loved ones.""
The website for the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections briefly showed a booking photo of Scheffler before the photo was removed. According to the website, Scheffler was released at 8:40 a.m. He was seen back at the golf club later in the morning.
The second round has been delayed by 1 hour and 20 minutes.
With cars backed in the morning darkness, other PGA-marked vehicles tried to move slowly toward the entrance. Traffic finally began to move slowly a little before 7 a.m.
It was a surreal start to what already has been a wild week of weather — the Masters champion and top-ranked in the world, dressed in workout clothes with his hands in cuffs behind his back amid flashing flights.
Darlington said police were not sure who he was. He said an officer asked him to leave and when he identified himself being with the media, he was told, ""There's nothing you can do. He's going to jail.""
Darlington said another police officer later approached with a notepad and asked if he knew the name of the person they put in handcuffs.
Scheffler is coming off four victories in his last five tournaments. He was home in Dallas for the last three weeks waiting on the birth of his first child, a son who was born on May 8.
Scheffler opened with a 4-under 67 and was five shots out of the lead in his attempt to become only the fifth player since 1960 to win the first two majors of the year.
Last month, Scheffler won his secondMasters Tournamentvictory in three years, finishing 11 under and four strokes up on his closest competitors.

Updated on:  May 17, 2024 / 2:39 AM EDT/ CBS News
The deadline is approaching to register to receive a piece of Apple's $35 million settlement with iPhone 7 or 7 Plus users who experienced audio issues with their device's microphone. Those eligible to make a claim can be awarded $50 to $349 from the tech giant.
The settlement is restricted to United States residents who owned one of those phone models between September 16, 2016 and January 3, 2023, and reported a covered audio issue to Apple or paid the company for repairs.
The deadline tosubmit a claimis June 3 via the settlement website.
Those who paid for repairs can receive a maximum of $349, while people who reported the issue but didn't pay for repairs can receive up to $125. The minimum payout for eligible claimants is $50.
The lawsuit was originally filed in 2019 by plaintiffs Joseph Casillas and De'Jhontai Banks, who both purchased iPhone 7's in 2017 and claimed they began experiencing issues the following year.
""Plaintiff Casillas noticed that his phone's sound was distorted with audible static while attempting to play a video on his phone,"" the complaint reads. ""Plaintiff Banks noticed that she was unable to hear callers unless she used her iPhone's speaker function. These are common indications of the Audio IC Defect.""
The suit describes the audio chip issue as a result of inadequate casing on the phones, further claiming that Apple has ""long been aware of the Audio IC Defect"" and routinely refused to repair affected phones free of charge.
In the settlement agreement, Apple denied the phones had any audio issues and said it did nothing improper or unlawful.

Stressis all around us, but so is an accessible antidote: the outdoors. Experts say getting outside can have a positive impact on both ourmentalandphysical health.
""The outdoors have so many amazing benefits for us,"" general pediatrician Dr. Vanessa Slotstold CBS Minnesota station WCCO. ""There are a lot of studies that show being in nature — even if it's just sitting under a tree every day — lowers our stress, which can then in turn lower blood pressure, heart rate and those stress hormones, like cortisol.""
In addition to helping people with anxiety and depression, Slots say there are ongoing studies on how outdoor time could also benefit people withADHD.
""It's been shown it can improve our memory, even,"" she adds.
The power of nature isn't a new school of thought. Doctors for years have known the benefits of spending time outdoors.
Clinical psychologist Dr. Sarah Paper previouslyexplainedthat sunlight is part of what makes time outside so uplifting.
""The sun seems to increase our serotonin, which makes us happier and we can feel more connected, not just to the people around us who are also outside, that's a big part, but also connected to the bigger universe,"" she said, adding that she recommends spending at least two hours a week in nature.
To optimize nature's calming effect, Slot suggests breathing in fresh air and focusing on the sights and sounds around you.
You don't need to live near a magnificent mountainside or other spectacular landscape to feel the effects, either.
""Even a pretty dandelion,"" Paper says. ""If you can take in the beauty there, and not just see it as a weed, that helps us and it trains our brain not to look for the negative or upsetting things but rather look for the beauty in the world around us. And that give us hope, too.""
Neuropsychologist Dr. Rita Eichensteintold CBS Los Angelesin 2021 that even a few minutes outside can reduce stress levels quickly, especially when paired with exercise.
""Research has shown that being in nature is calming,"" she said. ""If you have 20 minutes ... take it and move your body. Go around the block, get some fresh air, breathe in, breathe out. ... You will be a different person and it only takes 20 minutes.""
While the great outdoors can help our health, some parts of it can also hurt it — like skin cancer from the sun anddisease-carrying insects. Here are some tips to stay safe while de-stressing:
Wear sunscreen:A broad spectrum sunscreen with anSPF of 30 or higherisyour best defenseagainst the sun's harmful rays.
Protect against pests:Consider insect repellant if you're going to be outdoors for an extended period. The CDC advises using anEPA-registered insect repellentcontainingDEETor otherinsect-repelling ingredients, listedon its website. Once you return indoors, doa tick checkand keep an eye on any areas of a suspected bite.
Be cautious of extreme heat:The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommendstrying to stay indoors with air-conditioning when possible in the peak summer heat. But if you're going to venture outside, experts recommend wearing lightweight, loose-fitting clothing, staying hydrated and taking it slow to prevent issues likeheat stroke and heat exhaustion.

ByRobert Legare
May 16, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT/ CBS News
Washington— The Justice Department officially proposed a new rule on Thursday that would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, a policy move that would ease restrictions on cannabis on the federal level if ultimately approved.
While therescheduling of marijuanawould neither make the substance legal nor decriminalize it across the nation, changing the classification from its current Schedule I status to Schedule III would bring the drug into regulatory parity with other substances, like ketamine and anabolic steroids.
The Drug Enforcement Administration currently classifies marijuana as a substance that has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" The proposed rule would shift the DEA's treatment of the drug to one that has ""a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.""
The proposal kicks off a months-long comment and administrative period, meaning the rescheduling would not immediately take effect. After 60 days, officials will make a final determination before the rule is officially published.
In 2022, President Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to examine the DEA's marijuana classification. According to a Justice Department memo published last month, HHS ""concluded after reviewing several studies that there was some credible scientific support that marijuana could be used effectively"" in certain medical situations.
""No professional medical organization currently recommends use of marijuana,"" the memo said, adding that ""one recommends against its use."" Dozens of states already allow marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes or recreationally.
The notice of proposed rulemaking sent to the Federal Register on Tuesday said the attorney general ""concurs with HHS's recommendation, for purposes of initiation of these rulemaking proceedings, that marijuana has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.""
Mr. Biden called the move ""monumental"" in a video posted Tuesday and noted marijuana policy has been a priority of his administration.
Last year, the president moved to pardon thousands of Americans convicted at the federal level for simple possession of cannabis and urged governors to do the same. Advocates for a policy change, including Mr. Biden, have said marijuana scheduling has unduly affected minority populations and have resulted in harsh prison sentences for mere possession.
News of the proposed rescheduling broke in late April after Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DEA submitted the rule to administration officials for review. Critics of the move — including multiple former officials at the DEA who spoke with CBS News — said at the time that the administration was making a mistake because of risks posed by the drug's side effects. And the new rule, they said, would be a gateway to more dangerous substances.

Washington— The Justice Department said it is determining whether it will prosecute airplane manufacturer Boeing after federal investigators accused the corporation of violating the terms of a2021 deferred prosecution agreement, according to a letter filed in a Texas court Tuesday.
In January 2021 — followingtwo crashesof 737 Max jets years earlier that killed 346 people — Boeing and the federal government entered into an agreement whereby the company agreed to pay a $2.5 billion settlement and abide by custodial stipulations in exchange for the Justice Department dropping a fraud conspiracy charge after three years.
That three-year period, overseen by a federal judge in Texas, was set to expire in July and would have resulted in the Justice Department closing the case if it determined Boeing had fully complied with the conditions.
But on Tuesday, federal prosecutors wrote that Boeing ""breached its obligations"" under the deferred prosecution agreement, in part by allegedly failing to ""design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.""
""For failing to fulfill completely the terms of and obligations under the DPA, Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation,"" Justice Department officials wrote in the letter. ""The Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter.""
The letter argued that investigators are no longer bound by the 2021 agreement and are ""not limited"" in their probe into the aircraft manufacturing giant.
Boeing has until June 13 to respond to the Justice Department's allegations and their explanation will be used as prosecutors consider their next move, the filing said.
The news comes more than five months after the cabin door of an Alaska Airlines planeblew off mid-flight, sparking congressional and federal investigations. In March, a person familiar with the matterconfirmed to CBS Newsthat prosecutors were looking at whether anything that led up to or contributed to the blowout might affect the deferred prosecution agreement.
There was no mention of the Alaska Airlines flight in the letter.
In a statement provided to CBS News on Tuesday evening, a Boeing spokesperson acknowledged the company had received the letter, and said that ""we believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue. As we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.""
A former quality manager who blew the whistle on Spirit AeroSystems, a troubled Boeing supplier that builds the bulk of the 737 Max,told CBS Newshe was pressured to downplay problems he found while inspecting the plane's fuselages. Speaking publicly for the first time last week, Santiago Paredes said he often found problems while inspecting the area around the same aircraft door panel that flew off Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 just minutes after it had taken off from Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5.
Last month, families of some of the 737 Max crash victims met with Justice Department officials for an update on the case against Boeing. In their letter on Tuesday, prosecutors told the judge that the Justice Department ""will continue to confer with the family members of the victims of the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes,"" and that the Justice Department ""separately notified the victims and the airline customers today of the breach determination.""
""This is a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming,"" said Paul Cassell, an attorney who represents the families of some of the victims of the 737 crashes, in a statement. ""But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more detail what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing's ongoing criminal conduct.""
Robert A. Clifford, another attorney representing family members of victims of one of the 737 crashes, said in a statement, ""This is a way for Boeing to be held criminally responsible in court. It's what the families have wanted. They want answers as to what really happened in the crashes and for the safety of the public to be protected.""
The Justice Department declined to comment further when reached by CBS News.
